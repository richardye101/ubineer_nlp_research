# ## Topic Modelling Introduction
# 
# The goal of this section is to explore topic modelling techniques, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). 
# 
# These two methods share a very important characteristic: they detect _latent_ topics/meaning. This means that from the data we feed the models are all thats used to determine and shape topics.
# 
# These are very powerful tools that can help us identify what kind of data we're dealing with, but a limitation to these techniques is that if our data is skewed in a certain direction, ie data which only belongs to subcategories of a topic, or only a few niche topics.
# 
# In the next couple pages, we explore what these techniques can produce for us, and whether their reesults are any good.

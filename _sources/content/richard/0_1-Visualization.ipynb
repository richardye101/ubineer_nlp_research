    "Most of the analyses and work done in this report has been to perform unsupervised techniques to extract information from our data. As a result, many conclusions are in the form of document vector matrices, containing locations of each company filing in some n-dimensional space or its membership probability in m topics/industries. To accomplish this, we've devised a simple function that utilizes principle components analysis (PCA) to reduce our dimensions, condensing information into 2 and 3 dimensions for easy representation. Choosing to reduce to 10 dimensions (or less depending on the application) is simply arbitrary. We select the top 2-3 dimensions for representation, and (if available) use it's industry name to color code them.\n",

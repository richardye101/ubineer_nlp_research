2008-02-28T00:42:30Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1065280,"Item 1.Business  We are the largest online movie rentalsubscription service in the United States, providing approximately 7.5 million subscribers access to approximately 90,000 DVD titles plus a growing library of more than 6,000 choices that can be watched instantly on their personal computers, orPCs. We offer nine subscription plans, starting at $4.99 a month. There are no due dates, no late fees and no shipping fees. Subscribers select titles at our Web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service, receive them on DVD by U.S. mailand return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the next available DVD in a subscriber’s queue. We also offer certain titles through our instant-watching feature. The terms andconditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse.  Our subscription service has grown rapidly since inception. This growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of DVDs as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online DVD rentals. We alsobelieve our growth has been driven by our comprehensive selection of titles, consistently high levels of customer satisfaction and our effective marketing programs. We expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online DVDrentals continues to grow, a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model.  Our core strategy is to grow alarge DVD subscription business and to expand into Internet-based delivery of content as that market develops. We believe that the DVD format, along with its high definition successor formats, including Blu-ray will continue to be the mainvehicle for watching content in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large DVD subscription business, we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to Internet-based delivery of content. InJanuary 2007, we introduced our instant-watching feature for PCs. We intend to broaden the distribution capability of our instant-watching feature to other platforms and partners over time. In January 2008, we announced a development arrangementwith LG Electronics. While the terms of this arrangement have not been finalized, we anticipate developing, in conjunction with LG Electronics and other consumer electronics’ manufacturers, a set-top box device or other devices that will enableour instant-watching feature to be viewed directly on subscribers’ televisions.  Our proprietary recommendation service enables us tocreate a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandise our comprehensive library of content. We believe that our recommendation technology, based on proprietary algorithms and theapproximately 2.0 billion movie ratings collected from our subscribers, enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization.   1 Table of ContentsWe promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs, including online promotions,television and radio advertising, package inserts, direct mail and other promotions with third parties. These programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period. At the end of the free trial period,subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers, unless they cancel their subscription. All paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance.  We stock approximately 90,000 DVD titles. We have established revenue sharing relationships with several studios and distributors. We also purchase titles directly from studios, distributors and other suppliers. Inaddition, we have more than 6,000 choices available on our Web site for instant-watching.  We ship and receive DVDs throughout the UnitedStates. We maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allows us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers.  We are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs. Our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business, including our Web site interface,order processing, fulfillment operations and customer service. We believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements. We are organized in a single operating segment. All our revenues are generated in the United States, and we have no long-lived assetsoutside the United States. Substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees.  Industry Overview  Filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels, including movie theaters, airlines, hotels and in-home. In-home distributionchannels include home video rental and retail outlets, cable and satellite television, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, or VOD, and broadcast television. Currently, studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to sixmonths after theatrical release to the home video market, four to seven months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and VOD, one year after theatrical release to premium television and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cableand network television. However, in what continues to be an emerging trend, the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles, in particular the theatrical to home video window. We anticipate that the studios will continue totest a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional window, including releasing movies simultaneously on DVD and VOD, but we believe that DVD, and its high definition successors, such as Blu-ray, will continue to receive a preferentialdistribution window in light of the large profits DVD generates for the studios.  Challenges Faced by Consumers in Selecting In-HomeFilmed Entertainment  The proliferation of new releases available for in-home filmed entertainment and the additional demand for backcatalog titles on DVD create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles.  First, despite the large number of available titleson DVD, existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets stock a limited selection of titles, frustrating consumer demand for more choice. Subscription channels, pay-per-view and VOD services continue to offer a relatively narrowselection of titles. Likewise, traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalog titles. We believe our selection of approximately 90,000 titles on DVD offers an attractivealternative to these traditional channels.  Second, even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available, they generallyhave limited means to effectively sort through the titles. We believe our recommendation service and our Web site features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences.   2 Table of ContentsCompetitive Strengths  We believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths:    •  Comprehensive Library of Titles.    We have developed strategic relationships with top studios and distributors, enabling us to establishand maintain a broad and deep selection of DVD titles. Since our service is available nationally, we believe that we can economically acquire and provide subscribers a broader selection of DVD titles than video rental outlets, video retailers,subscription channels, pay-per-view and VOD services. To maximize our selection of DVD titles, we continuously add newly released DVD titles to our library. Our DVD library contains numerous copies of popular new releases, as well as many DVD titlesthat appeal to narrow audiences.    •  Personalized Merchandising.    We utilize our proprietary recommendation service to create a custom interface for each subscriber toeffectively merchandise our library. Subscribers rate titles on our Web site, and our recommendation service compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base. For each subscriber, these comparisons are used tomake predictions about specific titles the subscriber may enjoy. These predictions are used to merchandise titles to subscribers throughout the Web site. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 2.0 billion movie ratings in our database.We believe that our recommendation service allows us to create broad-based demand for our library and maximize utilization of each DVD.    •  Scalable Business Model.    We believe that we have a scalable, low-cost business model designed to maximize our revenues and minimizeour costs. As we continue to expand our subscriber base, we are able to leverage operational changes in a cost effective manner which further reduces our operating costs on a per subscriber basis. Such cost reductions include increased automationand vendor negotiating leverage. Subscribers’ prepaid monthly payments and the recurring nature of our subscription business provide working capital benefits and significant near-term revenue visibility. Our scalable infrastructure and onlineinterface allow us to service our large and expanding subscriber base from a network of low-cost shipping centers.    •  Convenience, Selection and Fast Delivery.    Subscribers can conveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue oftitles on our Web site. We create a unique experience for subscribers by serving pages on our Web site that are tailored to subscribers’ individual rental and ratings history. Based on each subscriber’s queue, we ship DVDs by first classmail. Subscribers return these DVDs to us in prepaid mailers. After receipt of returned DVDs, we mail our subscribers the next available DVD in their queue of selected titles. We have approximately 90,000 DVD titles to choose from, and ournationwide network of distribution centers allows us to offer fast delivery. In addition, we offer subscribers the ability to watch movies instantly on their PCs and anticipate offering this feature on other Netflix-enabled consumer electronicsdevices.  Growth Strategy  Our strategy to provide a premier filmed entertainment subscription service to our large and growing subscriber base includes the following key elements:    •  Providing Compelling Value for Subscribers.    We provide subscribers access to our comprehensive library of approximately 90,000 DVDtitles with no due dates, late fees or shipping charges for a fixed monthly fee. We merchandise titles in easy-to-recognize lists including new releases, by genre and other targeted categories. We also offer more than 6,000 choices through ourinstant-watching feature. Our convenient, easy-to-use Web site allows subscribers to quickly select current titles, reserve upcoming releases and build an individual queue for future viewing using our proprietary personalization technology. Weprovide service features to our subscribers that, among other things, enable social networking and further individualization of the service through establishment of sub-account queues and recommendations. Our recommendation service providessubscribers with recommendations of titles from our library. We quickly deliver DVDs to subscribers from our shipping centers located throughout   3 Table of Contents  the United States by U.S. mail, and we offer certain movies instantly through our instant-watching feature.    •  Utilizing Technology to Enhance Subscriber Experience and Operate Efficiently.    We utilize proprietary technology developed internallyto manage the processing and distribution of DVDs from our shipping centers. Our software automates the process of tracking and routing DVDs to and from each of our shipping centers and allocates order responsibilities among them. We continuouslymonitor, test and seek to improve the efficiency of our distribution, processing and inventory management systems as our subscriber base and shipping volume grows. We operate a nationwide network of shipping centers and continue to develop and growthis network to meet the demands of our operations.    •  Building Mutually Beneficial Relationships with Filmed Entertainment Providers.    We have invested substantial resources in establishingstrong ties with various filmed entertainment providers. We maintain an office in Beverly Hills, California that provides us access to the major studios. We acquire content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements or license agreements.We work with the content providers to determine which method of acquiring titles is the most beneficial for each party. Our growing subscriber base provides studios with an additional distribution outlet for popular movies and television series, aswell as niche titles and programs.  Our Web site—www.netflix.com  We have applied substantial resources to plan, develop and maintain proprietary technology to implement the features of our Web site, such as subscriptionaccount signup and management, personalized movie merchandising, inventory optimization and customer support. In addition, we offer subscribers the ability to watch certain movies instantly on their PCs and anticipate extending this capability toother Netflix-enabled devices. We also provide our subscribers with the ability to purchase certain previously viewed DVDs.  Ourrecommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database. This technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to eachsubscriber.  We believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating thepredictions from our recommendation service, each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history, inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber.  Our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers. We use a real-time postal address validator to helpour subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to promote speedy and accurate delivery. Subscribers pay for our service by a credit or debit card. We utilize third party services toauthorize and process our payment methods.  Throughout our Web site, we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities, allowing us tocontinuously optimize our Web site according to our needs, as well as those of our subscribers. We use random control testing extensively, including testing service levels, plans, promotions and pricing.  Our Web site is run on hardware and software co-located at a service provider offering reliable network connections, power, air conditioning and otheressential infrastructure. We manage our Web site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We utilize a variety of proprietary software and freely available and commercially supported tools, integrated in a system designed to rapidly and precisely diagnoseand recover from failures. We conduct upgrades and installations of software in a manner designed to minimize disruptions to our subscribers.   4 Table of ContentsMerchandising  Our merchandising efforts are based on the personal recommendations generated by our recommendation service. All subscribers and site visitors are given many opportunities to rate titles and, as of December 31, 2007, we have collectedapproximately 2.0 billion ratings. The ratings from our recommendation service help determine which available titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order. In doing so, we help our subscribers quickly find titles they are more likely toenjoy. Ratings also help determine which available titles are featured most prominently on our Web site in an effort to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity. Finally, data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists ofsimilar titles. Subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our recommendations tool to find other titles they might enjoy. This is a powerful method for catalog browsing and expanding library utilization.  We also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy. Thisinformation may include:    •  factual data, including length, rating, cast and crew, special DVD features and screen formats;    •  movie trailers and other editorial perspectives, including plot synopses and reviews written by our editors, third parties and by other Netflix subscribers; and   •  data from our recommendation service, including personal rating, average rating and other similar titles the subscriber may enjoy.  Marketing  We use multiple marketing channels throughwhich we attract subscribers to our service. Online advertising is an important channel for acquiring subscribers. We advertise our service online through paid search listings, banner ads, text on popular Web portals and other Web sites andpermission based e-mails. In addition, we have an affiliate program whereby we make available Web-based banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a self-assisted basis from our Web site and place on their Web sites. Wealso advertise our service on various regional and national television and radio stations. We utilize direct mail and print advertising to promote our services in certain consumer packaged goods. We also participate in a variety of cooperativeadvertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studios movies in Netflix promotional advertising. We believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by thebenefits of word-of-mouth advertising, our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs.  Content Acquisition  We acquire content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and license agreements.  Under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors, we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment for adefined period of time either to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee based on content utilization. After the revenue sharing period expires for a title, we generally have the option of returning the title to the studio,destroying the title or purchasing the title. The principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio. We also purchase titles from various studios, distributors and other supplierson a purchase order basis. Under these arrangements, we typically pay a per disc fee for each of the DVDs we purchase. For titles delivered through our instant-watching feature, we generally license the content directly for a period of time.Following expiration of the license term, we are no longer able to distribute the content through our instant-watching feature unless we extend or renew the associated license agreement.   5 Table of ContentsFulfillment Operations  We currently stock approximately 90,000 titles on more than 69 million DVDs. We have allocated substantial resources to developing, maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage thefulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our Web site, transaction processing systems, fulfillment operations, inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers.  We ship and receive DVDs from a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the United States. We believe our shipping centers allow us toimprove the subscription experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our DVDs through the U.S. Postal Service. We currently do not ship on weekends or holidays.  Customer Service  We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships withsubscribers depends, in part, on the strength of our customer support and service operations. Our customer service center is open seven days a week. In 2007, we substantially increased our investment in customer service in order to improve theoverall quality and level of service to our subscribers. In addition, we continue to focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and providing certain self-service features on our Web site, such as the ability to report and correctmost shipping problems. We continue to explore new avenues to deliver efficient problem resolution and feedback channels. Our customer service center is located in Hillsboro, Oregon.  Competition  The market for in-home filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject torapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. For example, consumers may subscribe to HBO, rent a DVD fromBlockbuster, buy a DVD from Wal-Mart or Amazon, download a movie from Apple, and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in the same month.  Video rental outlets, retailers and kiosk services with whom we compete include Blockbuster, Movie Gallery, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores, Best Buy and Redbox. We believe that we compete with these video rental outletsand movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection, convenience and price. We believe that our scalable business model, our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of approximately 90,000 DVD titlescompete favorably against traditional video rental outlets and retailers.  We also compete against other online and store-based DVDsubscription services, such as Blockbuster’s Total Access, subscription entertainment services, such as HBO, Showtime and Starz, pay-per-view and VOD providers and cable and satellite providers.  VOD and delivery of movies over the Internet may also emerge as a competitive distribution channel. Apple’s video iPod and Apple TV, Amazon’sUnbox and other companies ranging from Google and Yahoo! to Microsoft and Intel are active in Internet delivery of content. Progress in digital delivery, although slow and scattered, continues to be made. VOD for example, is now widely available todigital cable subscribers in major metropolitan areas, such as New York, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Internet delivery of movies to a computer is currently available from providers, such as iTunes, Hulu, Vongo, Movielink and CinemaNow. While we anticipate that new devices and services for delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years, we believe that DVD, andits high definition successors, including Blu-ray, will continue to dominate the home entertainment experience in the near term. At some point in the future, digital delivery directly to the home will surpass DVD. Our ability to personalize ourlibrary to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences and our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for DVD rentals positions   6 Table of Contentsus favorably to further develop our digital distribution offering as that market develops. The downloading market is segmented into rental of Internetdelivered content, the download-to-own segment and the advertising-supported online delivery segment, and we believe we will lead the rental segment with our instant-watching feature as it develops.  In late 2006, Blockbuster launched its integrated store-based and online program, Total Access, whereby Blockbuster online subscribers may return DVDsdelivered to them from Blockbuster Online to Blockbuster stores in exchange for an in-store rental. Total Access was aggressively priced and experienced rapid subscriber growth and large operating losses in the first half of 2007. In the secondhalf of 2007, Blockbuster adopted a new competitive strategy which emphasized profitable growth. As part of this new strategy, Blockbuster reduced their marketing spending and raised prices on Total Access, which we believe contributed to anacceleration in our subscriber growth.  We believe we are able to provide greater satisfaction for consumers who subscribe to our servicedue to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental and the broad and deep selection of DVD titles we offer subscribers. In addition, we have the ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on their selectionhistory, personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences, as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select, receive and returnDVDs.  Employees  As ofDecember 31, 2007, we had 1,542 full-time employees. We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our fulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments. As of December 31, 2007, we had 1,128part-time and temporary employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.  Intellectual Property  We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentialityagreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We have filed patents in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., we were issued broad business method patents covering, among other things, our subscription rental service in 2003 and 2006, andwe were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005. While our patents are an important element of our business, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a combination of patents. We have registeredtrademarks and service marks for the Netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks. Our software, the content of our Web site and other material which we create are protected by copyright. We also protectcertain details about our business methods, processes and strategies as trade secrets, and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage.  Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. To date, we have relied primarily onproprietary processes and know-how to protect our intellectual property. It is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage.  From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot assure that we will prevail in anyintellectual property dispute.   7 Table of ContentsOther Information  We were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002.

2009-02-25T21:22:45Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1065280,"Item 1.Business  With more than 10 millionsubscribers, we are the largest online movie rental subscription service in the United States. We offer a variety of subscription plans, with no due dates, no late fees, no shipping fees and no pay-per-view fees. We provide subscribers access toover 100,000 DVD and Blu-ray titles plus more than 12,000 streaming content choices. Subscribers select titles at our Web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service and merchandising tools. Subscribers can:    •  Receive DVDs by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the next available DVD in asubscriber’s queue.    •  Watch streaming content without commercial interruption on personal computers (“PCs”), Intel-based Macintosh computers (“Macs”) and televisions(“TVs”). The viewing experience is enabled by Netflix controlled software that can run on a variety of devices. These devices include PCs, Macs, Internet connected Blu-ray players, such as those manufactured by LG Electronics and Samsung,set-top boxes, such as TiVo and the Netflix Player by Roku, game consoles, such as Microsoft’s Xbox 360, and planned for later this year, TVs from Vizio and LG Electronics.  Our core strategy is to grow a large subscription business consisting of DVD by mail and streaming content. We offer over 100,000 titles on DVD. Incomparison, the 12,000 content choices available for streaming are relatively limited. We expect to substantially broaden the content choices as more content becomes available to us. Until such time, by bundling DVD and streaming as part of theNetflix subscription, we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely comprehensive selection of movies for one low monthly price. We believe this creates a competitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service. This advantage willdiminish over time as more content becomes available over the Internet from competing services, by which time we expect to have further developed our other advantages such as brand, distribution, and our proprietary merchandising platform. Despitethe growing popularity of Internet delivered content, we expect that the standard definition DVD, along with its high definition successor, Blu-ray, (collectively referred to in this Annual Report as “DVD”) will continue to be the primarymeans by which most Netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future. However, at some point in the future, we expect that Internet delivery of content to the home will surpass DVD.  We promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs, including online promotions, television and radio advertising, package inserts,direct mail and other promotions with third parties. These programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period. At the end of the free trial period, subscribers are automatically enrolled as payingsubscribers, unless they cancel their subscription. All paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance.   1 Table of ContentsWe stock over 100,000 DVD titles. We have established revenue sharing relationships with several studiosand distributors. We also purchase titles directly from studios, distributors and other suppliers. In addition, we have more than 12,000 content choices licensed for streaming.

We areorganized in a single operating segment. All our revenues are generated in the United States, and we have no long-lived assets outside the United States. Substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees.  Industry Overview  Motion pictures, including moviesand television programs (“entertainment video”) are distributed broadly through a variety of channels, including movie theaters, airlines, hotels and in-home. In-home distribution channels include DVD rental and retail outlets and websites, cable, satellite and telecommunication providers offering basic and premium television, pay-per-view, and video-on-demand (“VOD”) and Internet delivery. Currently, studios distribute their entertainment video content approximatelythree to six months after theatrical release to the home video market, three to seven months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and VOD, one year after theatrical release to premium television and two to three years after theatrical release tobasic cable and network television. Internet delivered content is made available typically at the same time as pay-per-view or VOD; however, some content, such as television shows, are often made available for Internet viewing shortly after theoriginal airing date. The major studios and television networks have continued to experiment with shortened release windows and we anticipate that they will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional windows,including releasing movies simultaneously on DVD and VOD. We believe, however, that DVD will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits DVD generates for the studios in the near term.  Challenges Faced by Consumers in Selecting In-Home Entertainment Video  The continued proliferation of new releases of entertainment video, coupled with the availability of a large and growing back catalog of titles on DVDcreate two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles.  First, despite the large number of available titles on DVD, existingsubscription channels and traditional DVD rental outlets stock a limited selection of titles, frustrating consumer demand for more choice. Subscription channels, pay-per-view and VOD services continue to offer a relatively narrow selection oftitles. Likewise, traditional DVD rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalog titles. We believe our selection of over 100,000 titles on DVD offers an attractive alternative to thesetraditional channels.  Second, even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available, they generally have limited means toeffectively sort through the titles. We believe our recommendation service, our merchandising practices and our other Web site features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences.   2 Table of ContentsCompetitive Strengths  We believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths:    •  Comprehensive Library of Titles.    We have well established relationships with major studios and distributors, enabling us to maintain abroad and deep selection of DVD titles. We also offer our subscribers access to a smaller library of titles available for streaming. Because of our scale, national footprint and Internet based subscription model, we believe that we can efficientlyacquire and provide subscribers a broader selection of DVD titles than DVD rental outlets, DVD retailers, and cable, satellite and telecommunication providers. In addition, by providing both DVD and streaming content as part of the Netflixsubscription, we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely comprehensive selection of movies for one low monthly price. To maximize our selection of DVD titles, we continuously add newly released DVD titles to our library. Our DVD library containsnumerous copies of popular new releases, as well as many DVD titles that appeal to narrow audiences.    •  Personalized Merchandising.    We utilize various tools, including our proprietary recommendation service, to create a custom interfacefor each subscriber to effectively merchandise our library. Subscribers rate titles on our Web site, and our recommendation service compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base. For each subscriber, thesecomparisons are used to make predictions about specific titles the subscriber may enjoy. These predictions, along with other factors, are used to help merchandise titles to subscribers throughout the Web site. We believe that our recommendationservice and our other merchandising practices allow us to create broad-based demand for our library and maximize utilization of our library.    •  Growing Scale.    We have achieved a level of scale in our business that provides many operational advantages. For example, we are ableto cost effectively automate many of our shipping and receiving processes, helping to drive down costs while also providing a better, more consistent experience to our subscribers. Also, our growing scale, namely, our more than 10 millionsubscribers, provides what we believe to be a key strategic advantage as our business expands into the Internet delivery of content. We believe that this large installed base of subscribers positions us well to compete in the Internet delivery ofcontent with companies that may have more recognizable names or more resources.    •  Convenience, Selection and Fast Delivery.    Subscribers can conveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue oftitles on our Web site. We create a unique experience for subscribers by serving pages on our Web site that are tailored to subscribers’ individual rental and ratings history. Based on each subscriber’s queue, we ship DVDs by first classmail. Subscribers return these DVDs to us in prepaid mailers. After receipt of returned DVDs, we mail our subscribers the next available DVD in their queue of selected titles.

Our software and equipment automate the process of tracking and routing DVDs to and from each of our shipping centers andallocate order responsibilities among them. We continuously monitor, test and seek to improve the efficiency of our distribution, processing and inventory management systems as our subscriber base and shipping volume grows. We operate a nationwidenetwork of shipping centers and continue to develop and grow this network to meet the demands of our operations.    •  Building Mutually Beneficial Relationships with Entertainment Video Providers.    We have invested substantial resources in establishingstrong ties with various entertainment video providers. We maintain an office in Beverly Hills, California that provides us access to the major studios. We obtain content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements or license agreements.

We believe that our ability topersonally merchandise our content through the Web site optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service, each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history,inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber. Subscribers pay for our service by a credit or debit card. We utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment methods. Throughout our Website, we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities, allowing us to continuously optimize our Web site according to our needs, as well as those of our subscribers. We use random control testing extensively, including testing service levels,plans, promotions and pricing.  Merchandising  We use our proprietary recommendation service along with other data, such as viewing history and inventory levels, to determine which titles are presented to a subscriber. In doing so, we believe we provide our subscribers with a quick andpersonalized way to find titles they are more likely to enjoy while also effectively managing our inventory utilization. Our merchandising efforts are used throughout our website to determine which titles are displayed to subscribers, including thegeneration of lists of similar titles. We believe our merchandising efforts create a powerful method for catalog browsing and efficient library utilization.  We also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy. This information may include:    •  factual data, including length, rating, cast and crew, special DVD features and screen formats;    •  movie trailers and other editorial perspectives, including plot synopses and reviews written by our editors, third parties and by other Netflix subscribers; and   •  data from our recommendation service, including personal rating, average rating and other similar titles the subscriber may enjoy.  Marketing  We use multiple marketing channels throughwhich we attract subscribers to our service. Online advertising is an important channel for acquiring subscribers. We advertise our service online through such vehicles as paid   4 Table of Contentssearch listings, banner ads, text links and permission based e-mails. In addition, we have an affiliate program whereby we make available Web-based bannerads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a self-assisted basis from our Web site and place on their Web sites. We also engage our consumer electronic partners to generate new subscribers for our service. We also advertise ourservice on various regional and national television and radio stations. We use targeted, solo direct mail, shared mail and newspaper print advertising to acquire new subscribers. We also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programswith studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studios movies in Netflix promotional advertising. We believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits ofword-of-mouth advertising, our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs.  Content Acquisition  We obtain content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and license agreements. Under our DVD and streaming revenue sharing agreements withstudios and distributors, we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment for a defined period of time either to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee based on content utilization. After therevenue sharing period expires for a DVD, we generally have the option of returning the DVD to the studio, destroying the DVD or purchasing the DVD. The principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generallyunique to each studio. We also purchase DVDs from various studios, distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis. Under these arrangements, we typically pay a per disc fee for each of the DVDs we purchase. For titles that are streamedto our subscribers, we generally license the content directly from studios and distributors for a defined period of time. Following expiration of the license term, we remove the content from our service unless we extend or renew the associatedlicense agreement.  Fulfillment Operations  We currently stock over 100,000 titles on more than 72 million DVDs. Not all titles are available in both standard definition DVD and Blu-ray formats. We have allocated substantial resources to developing, maintaining and testing thetechnology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our Web site, transaction processing systems, fulfillment operations, inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers. We ship and receive DVDsfrom a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the United States. We believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the customer experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our DVDs through the U.S. PostalService.  Customer Service  We believethat our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with subscribers depends, in part, on the strength of our customer support and service operations. As such, we work on maintaining and improving the overall quality and level ofcustomer service and support we provide to our subscribers. Our customer service center is located in Hillsboro, Oregon, and primarily handles subscriber inquiries by telephone. In addition, we continue to focus on eliminating the causes of customersupport calls and providing certain self-service features on our Web site, such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems. We continue to explore new avenues to deliver efficient problem resolution and feedback channels. Competition  The market for in-homeentertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home entertainment video providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. For example,consumers may subscribe to cable, rent a DVD from Redbox or Blockbuster, buy a DVD from Wal-Mart or Amazon, download a movie from Apple iTunes, watch a television show on Hulu.com, and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in thesame month. New competitors may be able to launch new businesses at a relatively low cost. DVDs and Internet   5 Table of Contentsdelivery of content represent only two of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing entertainment video. In addition, the growth in adoptionof DVD and Internet delivery of content is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies.  Our principal competitorsinclude:    •  DVD rental outlets and kiosk services, such as Blockbuster, Movie Gallery and Redbox;    •  video package providers with pay-per-view and VOD content including cable providers, such as Time Warner and Comcast; direct broadcast satellite providers, such asDIRECTV and Echostar; and telecommunication providers such as AT&T and Verizon;    •  online DVD subscription rental web sites, such as Blockbuster Online;    •  entertainment video retail stores, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com;    •  Internet movie and television content providers, such as Apple’s iTunes, Amazon.com, Hulu.com and Google’s YouTube.  While we anticipate that new devices and services for Internet delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years, we believe that DVD willcontinue to be an important part of the home entertainment experience for the foreseeable future. However, at some point in the future, we expect that Internet delivery of content directly to the home will surpass DVD.  We believe there will be three primary economic models for Internet delivered content: ad supported, such as Hulu.com and YouTube; pay-per-view ortransactional, such as Amazon’s Video on Demand and Apple iTunes; and, subscription, such as our service. It is our intent to focus exclusively on the subscription segment of Internet delivered content.  Employees  As of December 31, 2008, we had 1,644full-time employees. We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our fulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments. As of December 31, 2008, we had 1,626 part-time and temporary employees.Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.  Intellectual Property We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietaryintellectual property. We have filed patents in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., we were issued broad business method patents covering, among other things, our subscription rental service in 2003 and 2006, and we were issued a patent covering ourmailing and response envelope in 2005. While our patents are an important element of our business, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a combination of patents. We have registered trademarks and service marks for theNetflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks. Our software, the content of our Web site and other material which we create are protected by copyright. We also protect certain details about our businessmethods, processes and strategies as trade secrets, and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage.  Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. To date, we have relied primarily on proprietary processes andknow-how to protect our intellectual property. It is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage.  From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot assure that we will prevail in anyintellectual property dispute.   6 Table of ContentsOther Information  We were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002.

2010-02-22T19:09:32Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1065280,"Item 1.Business  With more than12 million subscribers, we are the world’s largest subscription service streaming movies and TV episodes over the Internet and sending DVDs by mail. Our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited movies and TV episodes streamed to their TVsand computers and can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes. We offer a variety of subscription plans, with no due dates, no late fees, no shipping fees and no pay-per-view fees. Aided by our proprietary recommendation and merchandisingtechnology, subscribers can select from a growing library of titles that can be watched instantly and a vast array of titles on DVD. On average, approximately 2 million discs are shipped daily from our distribution centers across the UnitedStates. Additionally, more than 48% of our subscribers instantly watched more than 15 minutes of streaming content in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Subscribers can:    •  Watch streaming content without commercial interruption on their computers and TVs. The viewing experience is enabled by Netflix controlled softwarethat can run on a variety of consumer electronics devices (“Netflix Ready Devices”). These Netflix Ready Devices currently include Blu-ray disc players, Internet-connected TVs, digital video players and game consoles.   •  Receive DVDs by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the nextavailable DVD in a subscriber’s queue.  Our core strategy is to grow a large subscription businessconsisting of streaming and DVD-by-mail content. By combining streaming and DVD as part of the Netflix subscription, we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely compelling selection of movies for one low monthly price. We believe this creates acompetitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service. This advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the Internet from competing services, by which time we expect to have further developed ourother advantages such as brand, distribution, and our proprietary merchandising platform. Despite the growing popularity of Internet delivered content, we expect that the standard definition DVD, along with its high definition successor, Blu-ray(collectively referred to as “DVD”), will continue to be the primary means by which a majority of Netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future. However, at some point in the future, we expect that Internet delivery ofcontent to the home will surpass DVD as the primary means by which most Netflix subscribers view content.  We promote ourservice to consumers through various marketing programs, including online promotions, TV and radio advertising, package inserts, direct mail and other promotions with third parties. We also engage  1 Table of Contentsour consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service. These programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period. At the end ofthe free trial period, subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers, unless they cancel their subscription. All paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance. We believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhancedby the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising, our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs.  We use ourproprietary recommendation and merchandising technology to determine which titles are presented to a subscriber. In doing so, we believe we provide our subscribers with a quick and personalized way to find titles they are more likely to enjoy whilealso effectively managing our inventory utilization. Our merchandising efforts are used throughout our web site and as part of the user interface on many Netflix Ready Devices to determine which titles are displayed to subscribers, including thegeneration of lists of similar titles. We believe our merchandising efforts create a powerful method for catalog browsing and efficient library utilization.  We obtain content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and license agreements with studios, distributors and other suppliers. DVD content is typically obtained through direct purchases orrevenue sharing agreements. Streaming content is generally licensed for a fixed fee for the term of the license agreement.  Weship and receive DVDs throughout the United States and maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allows us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers. We also utilize third party content delivery networks to help usefficiently stream movies and TV episodes in high volume to Netflix subscribers over the Internet.  We are focused on growingour subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology to minimize variable and fixed operating costs within the framework of providing a valuable and compelling user experience. Our technology isextensively employed to manage and integrate our business, including our Web site interface, order processing, fulfillment operations and customer service. We believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to runour fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements.  We are organized in a single operatingsegment. We currently generate all our revenues in the United States, although we plan to launch a limited international expansion with a streaming subscription service in 2010. Substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscriptionfees. We have no long-lived assets outside the United States.  Industry and competitive overview  We operate in the subscription segment of the in-home entertainment video market. In 2007, we expanded our DVD-by-mail distribution model toinclude streaming content over the Internet. This hybrid distribution model expands the consumer appeal of the Netflix subscription service beyond the traditional reach of the DVD rental segment and offers subscribers a uniquely compelling selectionof content, both streaming and DVD, for one low monthly price. While the consumer appeal of this hybrid service has grown quickly, the market for Internet delivered video content is still in its formative stages, and we expect competition to beintense.  Currently the market for Internet delivered video consists of three market segments: video-on-demand(“VOD”), ad supported, and subscription. The VOD segment includes competitors like Amazon, Apple, Blockbuster, Cinemanow and Microsoft. The ad supported segment includes competitors like Hulu and YouTube. Currently, Netflix is the primaryprovider in the subscription segment, but we expect direct and indirect competition to emerge and continue to grow as the consumer appeal for Internet delivery of video continues to expand.  The market for in-home entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneousrelationships with multiple in-home entertainment video providers and can  2 Table of Contentseasily shift spending from one provider to another. For example, consumers may subscribe to cable, rent a DVD from Redbox or Blockbuster, buy a DVD from Wal-Mart or Amazon, download a movie fromApple iTunes, watch a TV show on Hulu.com, and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in the same month. New competitors may be able to launch new businesses at a relatively low cost. DVDs and Internet delivery of content representonly two of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing entertainment video. In addition, the growth in adoption of DVD and Internet delivery of content is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies.  Our principal competitors include:    •  DVD rental outlets and kiosk services, such as Blockbuster, Movie Gallery and Redbox;    •  video package providers with pay-per-view and VOD content including cable providers, such as Time Warner and Comcast; direct broadcast satelliteproviders, such as DIRECTV and Echostar; and telecommunication providers such as AT&T and Verizon;    •  online DVD subscription rental web sites, such as Blockbuster Online;    •  entertainment video retail stores, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com; and    •  Internet movie and TV content providers, such as Apple’s iTunes, Amazon.com, Hulu.com and Google’s YouTube.  Studio licensing and movie distribution  Motion pictures, including movies and TV episodes (“entertainment video”) are distributed broadly through a variety of channels, including movie theaters, airlines, hotels and in-home. In-homedistribution channels include DVD rental, retail outlets and web sites, Internet delivery and cable, satellite and telecommunication providers offering basic and premium TV, pay-per-view and VOD. Currently, studios distribute movies approximatelythree to six months after theatrical release to the home video market, three to seven months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and VOD, one year after theatrical release to premium TV and two to three years after theatrical release to basiccable and network TV. Internet delivered content is made available typically at the same time as pay-per-view or VOD. However, some content, such as TV episodes, are often made available for Internet viewing shortly after the original airing date.The major studios and TV networks have continued to experiment with shortened release windows, and we anticipate that they will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional windows, including releasing moviessimultaneously on DVD and VOD.  Competitive strengths  We believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths:  Iconic brand.    Netflix has been highly rated in online retail customer satisfaction by independent surveys from Nielsen Online and in every one of the ten consecutive surveysconducted by ForeSee/FGI Research. Because of the high level of consumer satisfaction with Netflix, over 90 percent of surveyed subscribers say that they would recommend the Netflix service to a friend. We believe that these high levels of customersatisfaction and brand loyalty make it expensive and difficult for competitors to displace Netflix as a subscription segment leader.  Personalized merchandising.    We utilize various tools, including our proprietary recommendation technology, to create a custom interface for each subscriber. We believe that this customization enhances the userexperience by helping Netflix subscribers discover great movies. Subscribers rate titles through our service, and our recommendation technology compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base. For eachsubscriber, these comparisons are used to make predictions about specific titles the subscriber may enjoy. These predictions, along with other factors, are used to help merchandise titles to  3 Table of Contentssubscribers. We believe that our recommendation technology and our other merchandising practices allow us to create broad-based demand for our library and maximize utilization of our library. Bycreating demand for content, we seek to cost-effectively balance subscriber demand between newer, more expensive titles, and older, less expensive titles. Our ability to generate demand for these older, or “long-tail,” titles whilemaintaining high levels of customer satisfaction helps us manage and maintain our gross margin, subscriber acquisition cost, churn rate and lifetime subscriber profit. To that end, approximately 70% of the DVDs shipped during 2009 were titles withDVD release dates greater than 13 weeks.  Growing scale.    We have achieved a level of scale in ourbusiness that provides many operational and competitive advantages. From an operational perspective, for example, we are able to cost effectively automate many of our shipping and receiving processes, helping to drive down unit shipping costs whilealso providing a better, more consistent experience to our subscribers. Such scale economies also have contributed over time to expanding operating margins which has made it possible for Netflix to aggressively price its service offering at levelsdifficult for competition to meet.  Convenience, selection and fast delivery.    Subscribers canconveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue of titles on our Web site or by selecting titles directly from select Netflix Ready Devices. We create a unique experience for subscribers by generating user interfaces on ourWebsite and Netflix Ready Devices that are tailored to subscribers’ individual rental and ratings history. Subscribers rate approximately 20 million movies a week and Netflix has recorded more than 3 billion ratings to date. Based on eachsubscriber’s queue, we ship DVDs by first class mail and subscribers return these DVDs to us in prepaid mailers. After receipt of returned DVDs, we mail our subscribers the next available DVD in their queue of selected titles. We have a vastarray of titles on DVD and our nationwide network of distribution centers allows us to offer fast delivery. In addition, subscribers can select from a growing number of titles that can be watched instantly on their computers or TVs withoutcommercial interruption. The number of streaming content choices has grown approximately 30% over the year ended December 31, 2009 and is expected to continue to grow rapidly for the foreseeable future.  Growth strategy  Our corestrategy to grow a large subscription business consisting of streaming and DVD-by-mail content includes the following key elements:  Providing compelling value for subscribers.    For a low fixed monthly fee, we provide subscribers access to a growing library of movies and TV episodes that can be watched instantly and a vast selection of DVDtitles. We quickly deliver DVDs to subscribers from our shipping centers located throughout the United States by U.S. mail. Subscribers can, at no additional fee, also stream movies and TV episodes to their computers and TVs. There are no due dates,no late fees, no shipping fees and no pay-per-view fees. We merchandise titles in easy-to-recognize lists including new releases, by genre and other targeted categories. Our recommendation and merchandising technology provides subscribers withindividualized recommendations of titles from our library. Our convenient, easy-to-use Web site allows subscribers to quickly select current titles, reserve upcoming releases and build an individual queue for future viewing.  Utilizing technology to enhance subscriber experience and operate efficiently.    We utilize proprietary and othertechnology to manage the processing and distribution of DVDs from our shipping centers and the delivery of streaming content over the Internet. Our software and equipment automate the process of tracking and routing DVDs to and from each of ourshipping centers and allocate order responsibilities among them. We continuously monitor, test and seek to improve the efficiency of our distribution, processing and inventory management systems as our subscriber base and shipping volume grows. Weoperate a nationwide network of shipping centers and continue to develop this network to meet the demands of our operations. We also utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream movies and TV episodes in high volume toNetflix subscribers over the Internet.  Building mutually beneficial relationships with entertainment videoproviders.    We have invested substantial resources in establishing strong ties with various entertainment video providers. We maintain an  4 Table of Contentsoffice in Beverly Hills, California in order to maintain effective working relationships with the major studios. We obtain content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and licenseagreements. We work with the content providers to determine which method of acquiring titles is the most beneficial for each party. Our growing subscriber base provides studios with an additional distribution outlet for popular movies and TVepisodes, as well as niche titles and programs.  Expanding the number of devices capable of streaming video fromNetflix.    We have engaged a number of consumer electronics partners to offer instant streaming of content from Netflix to various devices. We currently offer subscribers the ability to stream content through their computersand other devices, including the Xbox 360, PlayStation3, Internet-connected TVs and Blu-ray players, TiVo, and the Roku video digital player. We intend to broaden our partner relationships over time so that more devices, such as the Nintendo Wiigame console, are capable of streaming content from Netflix. By providing consumers with a broad array of devices capable of streaming content from Netflix, we believe that we enhance the value of our service to subscribers as well as positionourselves for continued growth as the Internet delivery of content becomes more popular.  Our web site—www.netflix.com We apply substantial resources to develop and maintain technology to implement the features of our Web site, such as subscription accountsignup and management, personalized movie merchandising, inventory optimization and streaming content. We believe that our Web site provides our subscribers with an easy-to-use interface that enhances the value of our service. We believe that ourability to personally merchandise our content through the Web site optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation and merchandising technology, each subscriber’s currentqueue and viewing history, inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber. Subscribers pay for our service by a credit or debit card. We utilize third party services to authorize and process our paymentmethods.

2011-02-18T19:42:40Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1065280,"Item 1.Business  About us With 20 million subscribers as of December 31, 2010, Netflix Inc. (“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or“us”) is the world’s leading Internet subscription service for enjoying TV shows and movies. Our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited TV shows and movies streamed over the Internet to their TVs, computers and mobile devices and,in the United States, subscribers can also receive standard definition DVDs, and their high definition successor, Blu-ray discs (collectively referred to as “DVD”), delivered quickly to their homes. Our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business within the United States and globally. We are continuously improving thecustomer experience, with a focus on expanding our streaming content, enhancing our user interfaces and extending our streaming service to even more Internet-connected devices, while staying within the parameters of our operating margin targets. By continuously improving the customer experience, we believe we drive additional subscriber growth in the following ways:   •  Additional subscriber growth enables us to obtain more content, which in turn drives more subscriber growth.   •  Additional subscriber growth leads to greater word-of-mouth promotion of our service, which in turn leads to more subscriber growth at an increasinglycost-effective marketing spend.    •  Additional subscriber growth enables us to invest in further improvements to our service offering, which in turn leads to more subscriber growth. Our business has and continues to evolve rapidly. In 2010, we passed a significant milestone with themajority of our subscribers viewing more of their TV shows and movies via streaming than by DVD. Going forward, we expect we will be primarily a global streaming business, with the added feature of DVDs-by-mail in the U.S. We believe delivery ofentertainment video over the Internet will be a very large global market opportunity, and that our focus on one segment of that market—consumer-paid, commercial-free streaming subscription of TV shows and movies—will enable us to continueto grow rapidly and profitably.  Competition  The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. New competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost. Many consumers maintain simultaneous  1 Table of Contentsrelationships with multiple entertainment video providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. Our principal competitors include:   •  Multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) with free TV Everywhere and VOD (video-on-demand) content including cable providers, such as TimeWarner and Comcast; direct broadcast satellite providers, such as DIRECTV and Echostar; and telecommunication providers such as AT&T and Verizon;    •  Internet movie and TV content providers, such as Apple’s iTunes, Amazon.com, Hulu.com and Google’s YouTube;   •  DVD rental outlets and kiosk services, such as Blockbuster and Redbox;   •  Entertainment video retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com.  Operations  We obtain content from various studios and other contentproviders through fixed-fee licenses, revenue sharing agreements and direct purchases. We market our service through various channels, including online advertising, broad-based media, such as television and radio, as well as various strategicpartnerships. In connection with marketing the service, we offer free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. Rejoining members are an important source of subscriber additions. We utilize the services of third-party cloud computingproviders, more specifically, Amazon Web Services, as well as content delivery networks such as Level 3 Communications, to help us efficiently stream TV shows and movies. We also ship and receive DVDs in the United States from a nationwide networkof shipping centers.  Segments  We derive revenues from monthly subscription fees in our two segments, United States and International. In September 2010, we began international operations by offering an unlimited streaming plan withoutDVDs in Canada. We anticipate further international expansion to additional markets in the second half of 2011. We currently generate substantially all our revenues in the United States and hold all our long lived assets in the United States. Seasonality Our subscriber growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations in when consumers buy Internet-connected devices and when theytend to increase video watching. As a consequence, subscriber growth is generally greatest in our fourth and first quarters (October through March), slowing in our second quarter (April through June) and then accelerating in our third quarter (Julythrough September). Additionally, the variable expenses associated with shipments of DVDs are impacted by the seasonal nature of the DVD release of movies.  Intellectual Property  We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights,patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidential agreements toprotect our proprietary intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property.We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.  Employees As of December 31, 2010, we had 2,180 full-time employees. We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our DVDfulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments. As of December 31, 2010, we had 2,149 part-time and temporary employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider ourrelations with our employees to be good.   2 Table of ContentsOther information  We were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002.

2012-02-10T22:29:24Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1065280,"Item 1.Business  About us Netflix Inc. (“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading Internetsubscription service for enjoying TV shows and movies. Our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited TV shows and movies streamed over the Internet to their TVs, computers and mobile devices and in the United States, our subscribers can receivestandard definition DVDs, and their high definition successor, Blu-ray discs (collectively referred to as “DVD”), delivered quickly to their homes.  Our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business domestically and globally. We are continuously improving the customer experience, with a focus on expanding our streaming content,enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to even more Internet-connected devices, while staying within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment contribution profit targets. In the past, we havefocused on operating margin targets. Going forward, we will be operating within the parameters of contribution profit targets for each of our operating segments. Contribution profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenues and marketing expenses. We are a pioneer in the Internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch,we have developed an ecosystem of Internet-connected devices and have licensed increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their TVs, computers and mobile devices. As a result of these efforts, wehave experienced growing consumer acceptance of and interest in the delivery of TV shows and movies directly over the Internet. We believe that the DVD portion of our domestic service will be a fading differentiator to our streaming success. Prior to July 2011, in the United States, our streaming and DVD-by-mail operations were combined and subscribers couldreceive both streaming content and DVDs under a single “hybrid” plan. In July 2011, we introduced DVD only plans and separated the combined plans, making it necessary for subscribers who wish to receive both DVDs-by-mail and streamingcontent to have two separate subscription plans. This resulted in a price increase for our members who were taking a combination of our unlimited DVDs-by-mail and unlimited streaming services. We made a subsequent announcement during the thirdquarter of 2011 concerning the rebranding of our DVD-by-mail service and the separation of the DVD-by-mail and streaming websites. The consumer reaction to the price change, and to a lesser degree, the branding announcement, was very negative,leading to significant customer cancellations. We subsequently retracted our plans to rebrand our DVD-by-mail service and separate the DVD-by-mail and streaming websites.   1 Table of ContentsIn September 2010, we began international operations by offering our streaming service inCanada. In September 2011, we expanded our streaming service to Latin America and the Caribbean. In January 2012, we launched our streaming service in the UK and Ireland. We anticipate significant contribution losses in the International streamingsegment in 2012. Until we reach our goal of global profitability, we do not intend to launch additional international markets.

2018-03-12T20:45:43Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1660134,"Item 1. BusinessOverview Okta is the leading independent provider of identity for the enterprise. Our mission is to enable any organization to use any technology, and we believe identity is the key to making that happen. The Okta Identity Cloud is our category-defining platform that enables our customers to securely connect people to technology, anywhere, anytime and from any device.Identity has always been the key to establishing trust between users and technologies. We founded Okta in 2009 to reinvent identity for the cloud era, where identity is the critical foundation for connection and trust between users and technology. The Okta Identity Cloud helps organizations effectively harness the power of cloud and mobile technologies by securing users and connecting them with the applications they rely on.Every day, people use Okta to securely access a wide range of cloud applications, websites, mobile applications and services from a multitude of devices. Each of these users represents a unique user identification that authenticates into our platform. Workforces sign into our platform to seamlessly access the applications they need to do their most important work. Organizations also use our platform to provide their customers with more modern experiences online and via mobile devices, and to connect with partners to streamline their operations. Developers leverage our platform to securely embed identity into their software. As we add new customers, users, developers and applications to our platform, our business, customers and users benefit from powerful network effects that increase the value and security of the Okta Identity Cloud.Given the growth trends in the number of applications and cloud adoption, identity is quickly becoming the most critical layer of an organization’s security. As the corporate perimeter has dissolved, identity has become the most reliable way to manage user access, adopt cloud and mobile technologies and protect digital assets. Our approach to identity eliminates duplicative, sprawling credentials and disparate authentication policies, allowing our customers to simplify and scale their IT and security infrastructures more efficiently as the number of users, devices, clouds and other technologies in their ecosystem grows.We designed the Okta Identity Cloud to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing all of their identities. Our platform allows our customers to easily provision their customers, employees, contractors, and partners, enabling any user to connect to any device, cloud or application, all with a simple, intuitive and consumer-like user experience. Developers leverage the Okta Identity Cloud to secure and manage the identities of their own customers accessing their cloud and mobile applications. Our customers are able to achieve fast time to value, lower costs and increased efficiency while improving compliance and providing security that is persistent, perimeter-less and context-aware. These benefits are delivered through multiple products on a unified platform, our superior cloud architecture, and a vast and increasing network of integrations.The Okta Identity Cloud is an independent and neutral cloud-based identify platform that allows our customers to integrate with any prevalent application, service or cloud that they choose. We offer a complete and integrated identity stack that is built on a single code base, rather than a point solution that needs to be integrated with other identity products. In addition, we do not push our customers to particular vendors or a specific proprietary software stack. This independence and neutrality enables our customers to easily adopt the best technologies, and is designed to securely connect their users to the technology that they choose. We prioritize the compatibility of the Okta Identity Cloud with on-premise infrastructures and public, private and hybrid clouds. Our customers value our open approach, which enables them to future proof their environments.As of January 31, 2018, more than 4,350 customers across nearly every industry used the Okta Identity Cloud to secure and manage identities around the world. Our customers are comprised of leading global organizations ranging from the largest enterprises, to small and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits and government agencies. We partner with leading application and infrastructure vendors, such as Amazon Web Services, Box, Google Cloud, Microsoft, NetSuite, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday. We had over 5,500 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure providers as of January 31, 2018, which while not directly correlated to revenue, shows the breadth and acceptance of our platform. 4We employ a SaaS business model, and generate revenue primarily by selling multi-year subscriptions to our cloud-based offerings. We focus on acquiring and retaining our customers and increasing their spending with us through expanding the number of users who access our platform and up-selling additional products. We sell our products directly through our field and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through our network of independent software vendors, or ISVs, and channel partners. The Okta Identity Cloud The Okta Identity Cloud is a secure, reliable and scalable platform that provides comprehensive identity management, enabling our customers to secure their users and connect them to technology and applications, anywhere, anytime and from any device. Our customers use the platform to secure their workforces, to provide more seamless experiences for their customers, and to create solutions that make their partner networks more collaborative.The Okta Identity Cloud is used as the central system for an organization’s connectivity, access, authentication and identity lifecycle management needs spanning all of its users and applications.We enable our customers to easily deploy, manage and secure applications and devices, and to provision and support users across their IT environments, with a simple, intuitive, consumer-like user experience. Developers are similarly able to leverage a robust set of tools to quickly build custom web and mobile application experiences that leverage the Okta Identity Cloud as the underlying identity platform. Once deployed, we enable administrators to enforce contextual access management decisions based on conditions such as user identity, device, location, application identity, IP reputation and time of day.The Okta Identity Cloud is used by organizations in two distinct and powerful ways. It is used to manage and secure their extended enterprise (employees, contractors and partners), which we previously referred to as our internal use case. It is also used to manage and secure an organization’s customers’ identities via the powerful APIs we have developed, which we previously referred to as our external use case.The Okta Identity Cloud for the Extended EnterpriseThe Okta Identity Cloud simplifies the way an organization’s extended enterprise connects to its applications and data from any device, while increasing efficiency and keeping IT environments secure. We enable organizations to provide their users with immediate and secure access to every application they need from any device they use, without requiring multiple credentials, which significantly enhances user connectivity and productivity. We offer our customers an additional security layer through our Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication product. As our customers’ assets continue to migrate outside of the firewall, we believe this product is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to secure users and data. Our Universal Directory and Lifecycle Management products also serve as a system of record to help our customers organize, customize and manage their users and their access privileges throughout the users’ entire lifecycle. This includes managing all requests and approvals and automating account and device provisioning and de-provisioning seamlessly across directories, applications and devices. The Okta Identity Cloud enables our customers to automate access across their growing ecosystem of employees, contractors and partners, increasing collaboration across their extended enterprise.The Okta Identity Cloud to Transform the Customer ExperienceThe Okta Identity Cloud also enables organizations to transform their customer’s experience by empowering development teams to rapidly and securely build customer-facing cloud, mobile or web applications. Managing identity-centric connectivity for an organization’s customers in this way is a relatively new use case. We enable an organization’s product team to layer our powerful identity platform into their cloud, web and mobile applications through our APIs. This makes it easier for them to authenticate, manage and secure their connections, enabling rapid product innovation for the business. Organizations are able to centrally manage policy and API-level access across their development efforts, leading to more seamless customer experiences that are personalized, engaging and secure. Growth Strategy Key elements of our growth strategy are to:Execute with Our Existing Platform•Drive New Customer Growth.   To increase our market share, we intend to continue to grow our customer base, with a focus on key verticals, including highly-regulated sectors. 5•Deepen Relationships Within Our Existing Customer Base.   We plan to further increase revenue from our existing customers by cross-selling and up-selling additional products. We also believe we can expand our footprint by focusing on current customers that have deployed the Okta Identity Cloud for the extended enterprise, and expanding those customers’ use of our platform to managing their customers’ identities, or vice versa.•Expand Our Integrations and Partner Ecosystem.  The Okta Integration Network is an extensive partner ecosystem, which includes, among thousands of others, integrations with Amazon Web Services, Atlassian, Box, DocuSign, Google Cloud, Microsoft, NetSuite, SAP, ServiceNow, Slack, Workday, Workplace by Facebook, and Zendesk. We plan to continue these partnerships as well as add new integration partners to enrich our user experience and expand our customer base. We view our investment in partnerships as a force multiplier that enables us to build and promote complementary capabilities that benefit our customers. We also plan to expand our indirect sales network to leverage the sales efforts of additional ISVs and channel partners.•Expand Our International Footprint.  With 15% of our revenue generated outside of the United States in fiscal 2018, up from 13% in fiscal 2017, we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our international business. We believe global demand for our products will continue to increase as international organizations fully embrace cloud and mobile computing. Increase Our Opportunities•Innovate and Advance Our Platform with New Products and Use Cases.   We intend to continue making significant investments in research and development, hiring top technical talent and maintaining an agile organization. By continuing to innovate, we believe that we can address new use cases and offer increasing value to existing and potential customers.•Leverage Our Unique Data Assets with Powerful Analytics.  Our position at the intersection of people, devices, applications and infrastructure gives us unique access to powerful data, and the opportunity to provide differentiated insights based on that data. We expect the value of our analytics will increase as customers continue to connect more devices, applications and users to their networks and as we add more customers. We do not currently derive revenue from our unique data assets, but we intend to explore opportunities for monetization in the future.Our Products The Okta Identity Cloud consists of a suite of products to manage and secure identities, and it is used by IT organizations to secure their extended enterprise and also by developers to build customer-facing websites and applications.  Products used for the extended enterprise are consumed through Okta-branded web and mobile interfaces, and provide simple ways for IT organizations to manage identities for their employees, contractors and partners. Our APIs are used by developers to embed Okta identity functionality into their own customer-facing web or mobile applications. We continuously improve the Okta Identity Cloud through the release and development of additional products and features, with weekly updates. •Universal Directory.  Universal Directory provides a centralized, cloud-based system of record to store and secure user, application and device profiles for an organization. Users and profiles stored in the directory can be used with our Single Sign-On product to manage passwords and authentication, or can be used by developers to store and authenticate the users of their applications. When used to its fullest to manage and secure identities for the extended enterprise, Universal Directory becomes an organization’s system of record for all of its employees, partners and contractors.•Single Sign-On.  When used to manage and secure identities for the extended enterprise, Single Sign-On enables users to access all of their applications, whether in the cloud or on-premise, from any device, with a single entry of their user credentials. We combine secure access, modern protocols, flexible policies and a consumer-like user experience to permit organizations to easily allow customers or partners to sign in to their applications with their existing identity information. Single Sign-On also enables built-in reporting and analytics that provide real-time search functionalities across users, devices, applications and the associated access and usage activity.•Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication.  Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication is a comprehensive, but simple-to-use, product that provides an additional layer of security for an organization’s web and mobile applications and data. We offer an intelligent approach to security, built on contextual data. Adaptive Multi-Factor 6Authentication, standard in our product since late 2017, includes a policy framework that is integrated with a broad set of cloud and on-premise applications and network infrastructures. It offers adaptive, risk-based authentication that leverages data intelligence from across the Okta network of thousands of organizations.•Lifecycle Management.  Lifecycle Management enables IT organizations or developers to manage a user's identity throughout its entire lifecycle. It automates IT processes and ensures user accounts are created and deactivated at the appropriate times, including the workflow and policies needed to power those processes. With Okta Lifecycle Management, organizations can securely manage the entire identity lifecycle, from on-boarding to off-boarding, and ensure compliance requirements are met as user roles evolve and access levels change. •API Access Management.  API Access Management enables organizations to secure APIs as systems connect to each other. Access to these APIs is managed based on the user, which enables organizations to centrally maintain one set of permissions for any employee, partner or customer across every point of access. API Access Management reduces development time, boosts security and enables seamless end-user experiences by providing a unified portable service for authorizing secure and always available access to any API.•Mobility Management.  Mobility Management simplifies and automates mobile device administration and provisioning across phones, tablets and laptops, to ensure that devices are secure. In late 2017, we ceased investing in mobility management as a stand-alone product, focusing more on mobile access management as part of our Sign-On product.  We will continue to support Mobility Management for existing clients through the duration of their contracts.By focusing on identity, the one constant in an ever-changing technology and threat landscape, the Okta Identity Cloud provides our customers with a solution to solve their IT and security challenges. Our Technology We focus on engineering a simple but comprehensive platform to solve complex problems. Our pure cloud architecture is multi-tenant, encrypted and third-party validated. Okta Integration NetworkOur Okta Integration Network contains over 5,500 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure providers from Amazon Web Services, Atlassian, Box, Cisco, Citrix, DocuSign, F5 Networks, Google Cloud, Microsoft, MuleSoft, NetSuite, Palo Alto Networks, SAP, ServiceNow, Slack, Splunk, Workday, Workplace by Facebook, Zendesk and Zoom, among thousands of others. At the core of the Okta Integration Network is a patented technology that allows our customers to seamlessly connect to any application or type of device that is already integrated into our network.One Platform with Differentiated Administration, User and Developer ExperienceThe Okta Identity Cloud is built on one common platform and user interface framework, offering administrators and users a consistent, easy-to-use, consumer-like experience across our products. Our technology integrates with industry-leading browsers and mobile applications to provide seamless access to any web or native mobile application. We also heavily leverage operating system management and security technologies across desktops, laptops and mobile devices to provide a transparent, but secure experience for users across a range of devices. These integrations allow us to seamlessly deliver connectivity use cases that previously required significant custom development to achieve.Robust SecuritySecurity is a mission-critical issue for Okta and for our customers. Our approach to security spans day-to-day operational practices to the design and development of our software to how customer data is segmented and secured within our multi-tenant platform. We ensure that access to our platform is securely delegated across an organization. Our source code is updated weekly, and there are audited and verifiable security checkpoints to ensure source code fidelity and continuous security review. We have attained SOC 2, CSA Star 2, Level 2 Attestation, ISO/IEC 27001:2013, ISO/IEC 27018:2014 and HIPAA certifications and the FedRAMP Moderate Authority to Operate. We also plan to meet the requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 by May 25, 2018. 7Scalability and UptimeOur technical operations and engineering teams are designed around the concept of an always-on, highly redundant and available platform that we can upgrade without customer disruption. Our products and architecture were built entirely in and for the cloud with availability and scalability at the center of the design, and were built to be agnostic with respect to the underlying infrastructure. Our maintenance windows do not require any downtime.Our proprietary cell architecture includes redundant, active-active availability zones with cross-continental disaster recovery centers, real-time database replication and geo-distributed storage. If one of our systems goes down, another is quickly promoted. Our architecture is designed to scale both vertically by increasing the size of the application tiers and horizontally by adding new geo-distributed cells.Our platform is monitored not only at the infrastructure level but also at the application and third-party integration level. Synthetic transaction monitoring allows our technical operations team to detect and resolve issues proactively.Our Customers As of January 31, 2018, we had over 4,350 customers on our platform. Our customers span nearly all industry verticals and range from small organizations with fewer than 100 employees to companies in the Fortune 100, with up to hundreds of thousands of employees, some of which use the Okta Identity Cloud to manage millions of their customers' identities. Sales and Marketing SalesWe sell directly to customers through our inside and field sales force and also indirectly through our extensive ecosystem of channel partners. Once a sale is made, we leverage our land-and-expand sales model to generate incremental revenue, often within the term of the initial agreement, through the addition of new users and the sale of additional products. In many instances, we find that initial customer success with our platform results in key internal decision makers expanding their deployments, for example, from initial use for their extended enterprise to expanded use of our platform to manage their customers’ identities. Furthermore, as our customers are successful in their businesses and increase headcount, we share in their growth as the number of identities that we manage increases. Our sales organization is structured to address the specific needs of each segment of our target market. Our sales team is divided by geography, customer size, use case and industry vertical. Our direct sales force is supported by our sales engineers, security team, cloud architects, professional services team and other technical resources.We benefit from an expansive partner ecosystem that helps drive additional sales. Nearly all of the leading cloud application providers are our partners, and many of them drive further customer acquisition for us through co-selling arrangements, building our offerings directly into their products, and product demonstrations running on the Okta Identity Cloud. We also partner with several of the large technology companies that are driving the movement to the cloud. In addition to these technology partners, we leverage system integrators, traditional VARs and Government VARs to broaden the range of customers we reach.MarketingOur most valuable marketing features our customers and their successes, and is informed by a deeply data-driven approach, giving us insights into the efficacy of our efforts. Our marketing efforts focus on promoting our industry-leading identity platform, establishing our brand, generating awareness, creating sales leads and cultivating the Okta Community.A centerpiece of our marketing strategy is our annual customer conference, Oktane, that features customers sharing their success stories, new product and feature announcements and hands-on product labs.Research and Development Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, creation and the quality of the Okta Identity Cloud. The research and development organization also works closely with our technical operations team to ensure the successful deployment and monitoring of our platform. We utilize test automation and application monitoring to ensure the Okta Identity Cloud is always-on. Our research and development expenses for the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were $70.8 million, $38.7 million and $28.8 million, respectively.8Customer Support and Professional Services Our products are designed for ease of use and fast deployments. We also offer several programs to help our customers maximize their success with our products.Customer Support and Training ServicesWe offer three tiers of support, each of which builds upon the previous tier. We provide live webinars as well as on-demand instructional videos to provide our customers with information about product features, functionality and our most common customer use cases.Professional ServicesOur professional services team provides assistance to customers in the deployment of the Okta Identity Cloud and includes identity, mobility and security experts, customized deployment plans and SmartStart, which provides a quick path to implementation.Okta CommunityWe have created the Okta Community, an online community available to all of our customers that enables them to connect with other customers and partners to ask questions and find answers. Intellectual Property We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology.As of January 31, 2018, we had ten issued patents in the United States, which expire between 2030 and 2035 and cover various aspects of our products. In addition, as of such date, we also had three issued patents in Australia, which expire between 2033 and 2035, and one issued patent in New Zealand expiring in 2034. We registered “Okta” as a trademark in the United States, the European Community, Australia, Canada and Japan. We also have filed other trademark applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions.We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Okta” and similar variations.In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. Our employees, consultants and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both general and product-specific terms of use. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our Competitors Our competitors for Okta Identity Cloud products to manage identities for the extended enterprise include:•Authentication providers, such as Computer Associates, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and SailPoint;  •Life Cycle Management providers, such as Computer Associates, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle; •Multi-factor Authentication providers, such as RSA (a division of Dell Technologies), Microsoft and Symantec; and •Infrastructure-as-a-service providers, such as Microsoft, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services.For organizations to manage their customers’ identities, the Okta Identity Cloud generally competes with internally developed systems.We also compete with small, private niche companies that offer point products that attempt to address certain of the problems that our platform solves.9Due to the flexibility and breadth of our platform, we can and often do co-exist alongside our competitors’ products within our customer base.The principal competitive factors in our markets include product capabilities, flexibility, independence, total cost of ownership, time to value, scalability, user experience, number of pre-built integrations, customer satisfaction, global reach, and ease of integration, management and use. We believe our product strategy, technology and company culture allow us to compete favorably on each of these factors.We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true as we are a cloud-based offering, and our competitors may also seek to repurpose their existing offerings to provide identity management solutions with subscription models.With the recent increase in merger and acquisition transactions in the technology industry, particularly transactions involving cloud-based technologies, there is a greater likelihood that we will compete with other large technology companies in the future. Many of our competitors, particularly the large technology companies named above, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution, customer support or other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. However, we believe that our platform architecture, position as an independent provider of identity solutions and focus on innovation enable us to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than our larger competitors that primarily focus on other market segments and tie their identity solutions to their other proprietary products.Additional information regarding our competition is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Okta for GoodOkta for Good’s mission is to mobilize our technology and people to enable non-profit organizations to achieve their missions faster.

2019-03-14T21:03:10Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1660134,"Item 1. Business  OverviewOkta is the leading independent identity management platform for the enterprise. Our vision is to enable any organization to use any technology, and we believe identity is the key to making that happen. The Okta Identity Cloud is our category-defining platform that enables our customers to securely connect people to technology, anywhere, anytime and from any device.Identity has always been the key to establishing trust between users and technologies. We founded Okta in 2009 to reinvent identity for the cloud era, where identity is the critical foundation for connection and trust between users and technology. The Okta Identity Cloud helps organizations effectively harness the power of cloud, mobile and web technologies by securing users and connecting them with the applications they rely on.Every day, millions of people use Okta to securely access a wide range of cloud, mobile and web applications, IT infrastructure providers and services from a multitude of devices. Employees and contractors sign into the Okta Identity Cloud to seamlessly and securely access the applications they need to do their most important work.  Organizations use our platform to collaborate with their partners, and to provide their customers with more modern experiences online and via mobile devices. Developers leverage our platform to securely embed identity into their software. As we add new customers, users, developers and integrations to our platform, our business, customers, partners and users benefit from powerful network effects that increase the value and security of the Okta Identity Cloud.Given the growth trends in the number of applications and cloud adoption, identity is quickly becoming the most critical layer of an organization’s security. As organizations shift from network-based security models to a Zero Trust security model focusing on adaptive and context-aware controls, identity has become the most reliable way to manage user access and protect digital assets. Our approach to identity allows our customers to simplify and scale their IT and security infrastructures more efficiently as the number of users, devices, clouds and other technologies in their ecosystem grows.We designed the Okta Identity Cloud to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing all of their identities. Our platform allows our customers to easily provision their customers, employees, contractors, and partners, enabling any user to connect to any device, cloud or application, all with a simple, intuitive and consumer-like user experience.The Okta Identity Cloud is an independent and neutral cloud-based identity platform that allows our customers to integrate with any prevalent application, service or cloud that they choose. We offer a complete and integrated identity stack that is built on a single code base, rather than a point solution that needs to be integrated with other identity products. In addition, we do not push our customers to particular vendors or a specific proprietary software stack. This independence and neutrality enables our customers to easily adopt the best technologies, and is designed to securely connect their users to the technology that they choose. We prioritize the compatibility of the Okta Identity Cloud with on-premise infrastructures and public, private and hybrid clouds. Our customers value our open approach, which enables them to future-proof their environments.As of January 31, 2019, more than 6,100 customers across nearly every industry used the Okta Identity Cloud to secure and manage identities around the world. Our customers are comprised of leading global organizations ranging from the largest enterprises, to small and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits and government agencies. We partner with leading application and infrastructure vendors, such as Amazon Web Services, Box, Google Cloud, Microsoft, NetSuite, SailPoint, SAP, ServiceNow, VMware and Workday. We had over 6,000 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure providers as of January 31, 2019, which while not directly correlated to revenue, shows the breadth and acceptance of our platform.We employ a SaaS business model, and generate revenue primarily by selling multi-year subscriptions to our cloud-based offerings. We focus on acquiring and retaining our customers and increasing their spending with us through expanding the number of users who access our platform and up-selling additional products. We sell our products directly through our field and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners, including resellers, independent software vendors, or ISVs, system integrators and other distribution partners.5The Okta Identity CloudThe Okta Identity Cloud is a secure, reliable and scalable platform that provides comprehensive identity management, enabling our customers to secure their users and connect them to technology and applications, anywhere, anytime and from any device. Our customers use the platform to secure their workforces, to create solutions that make their partner networks more collaborative, and to provide more seamless and secure experiences for their customers.The Okta Identity Cloud can be used as the central system for an organization’s connectivity, access, authentication and identity lifecycle management needs spanning all of its users, technology and applications.We enable our customers to easily deploy, manage and secure applications and devices, and to provision and support users across their IT environments, with a simple, intuitive, consumer-like user experience. Developers are similarly able to leverage a robust set of tools to quickly build custom cloud, mobile and web application experiences that leverage the Okta Identity Cloud as the underlying identity platform. Once deployed, we enable administrators to enforce contextual access management decisions based on conditions such as user identity, device, location, application identity, IP reputation and time of day.The Okta Identity Cloud is used by organizations in two distinct and powerful ways. It is used to manage and secure their employees, contractors and partners, which we refer to as workforce identity. It is also used to manage and secure the identities of an organization’s own customers via the powerful APIs we have developed, which we refer to as customer identity. The Okta Identity Cloud for Workforce IdentityIn workforce identity use cases, the Okta Identity Cloud simplifies the way an organization’s employees, contractors and partners connect to its applications and data from any device, while increasing efficiency and keeping IT environments secure. We enable organizations to provide their workforces with immediate and secure access to every application they need from any device they use, without requiring multiple credentials, which significantly enhances user connectivity and productivity. We offer our customers an additional security layer through our Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication product. As our customers’ assets continue to migrate outside of the firewall, we believe this product is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to secure users and data. Our Universal Directory and Lifecycle Management products also serve as a system of record to help our customers organize, customize and manage their users and their access privileges throughout the users’ entire lifecycles. This includes managing all requests and approvals and automating account and device provisioning and de-provisioning seamlessly across directories, applications and devices. The Okta Identity Cloud enables our customers to automate access across their growing ecosystem of employees, contractors and partners, increasing collaboration across their workforces.The Okta Identity Cloud for Customer IdentityIn customer identity use cases, the Okta Identity Cloud enables organizations to transform their own customers’ experiences by empowering development teams to rapidly and securely build customer-facing cloud, mobile or web applications. Managing identity-centric connectivity for an organization’s customers in this way is a relatively new use case. We enable an organization’s product team to layer our powerful identity platform into their cloud, web and mobile applications through our APIs. This makes it easier for them to authenticate, manage and secure their connections, enabling rapid product innovation for the business. Organizations are able to centrally manage policy and API-level access across their development efforts, leading to more seamless customer experiences that are personalized, engaging and secure.Growth StrategyKey elements of our growth strategy are to:Execute with Our Existing Platform •Drive New Customer Growth.   To increase our market share, we intend to continue to grow our customer base using a land-and-expand sales model, with a focus on key market segments by size of customers, as well as key verticals, including highly-regulated sectors.•Deepen Relationships Within Our Existing Customer Base.   We plan to further increase revenue from our existing customers by cross-selling and up-selling additional and new products. We also believe we can expand our footprint by focusing on current customers that have deployed the Okta Identity Cloud for workforce identity, and expanding those customers’ use of our platform for customer identity, or vice versa.6•Expand Our Integrations.  The Okta Integration Network is an extensive partner ecosystem, which includes  over 6,000 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure providers. We plan to continue these partnerships as well as add new integration partners to enrich our user experience and expand our customer base. We view our investment in partnerships as a force multiplier that enables us to build and promote complementary capabilities that benefit our customers. •Expand Our Channel Partner Ecosystem.  We also plan to expand our indirect sales network to leverage the sales efforts of additional resellers, ISVs, system integrators and other distribution partners, and to increase the contribution we receive from these channel partners.•Expand Our International Footprint.  With 16% of our revenue generated outside of the United States in fiscal 2019, up from 15% in fiscal 2018, we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our international business. We believe global demand for our products will continue to be a long-term growth driver as organizations outside the United States fully embrace the transition to cloud computing, and larger international organizations take advantage of technology consolidation within their global locations.Increase Our Opportunities•Innovate and Advance Our Platform with New Products.   We intend to continue making significant investments in research and development, hiring top technical talent and maintaining an agile organization. By continuing to innovate, we believe that we can introduce new products and offer increasing value to existing and potential customers.•Extend Our Accessible Market with New Use Cases.  As technology and our customers’ markets evolve, we plan to use our platform to help our customers address new challenges, regulatory requirements and use cases as they develop.  •Leverage Our Unique Data Assets with Powerful Analytics.  Our position at the intersection of people, devices, applications and infrastructure gives us unique access to powerful data, and the opportunity to provide differentiated insights based on that data. We expect the value of our analytics to our customer base will increase as customers continue to connect more devices, applications and users to their networks and as we add more customers. We do not currently derive direct revenue from our unique data assets, but we may explore opportunities for monetization in the future. Our ProductsThe Okta Identity Cloud consists of a suite of products to manage and secure identities.  Products used for workforce identity are consumed through web and mobile interfaces, and provide simple ways for IT organizations to manage identities for their employees, contractors and partners. For customer identity, our APIs are also used by developers to embed Okta identity functionality into their own customer-facing mobile or web applications. We continuously improve the Okta Identity Cloud through the release and development of additional products and features, with weekly updates.•Universal Directory.  Universal Directory provides a centralized, cloud-based system of record to store and secure user, application and device profiles for an organization. Users and profiles stored in the directory can be used with our Single Sign-On product to manage passwords and authentication, or can be used by developers to store and authenticate the users of their applications. When fully utilized to manage and secure identities for a customer’s workforce, Universal Directory becomes a customer’s system of record for all of its employees, contractors and partners.•Single Sign-On.  When used to manage and secure identities for a customer’s workforce, Single Sign-On enables users to access all of their applications, whether in the cloud or on-premise, from any device, with a single entry of their user credentials. We combine secure access, modern protocols, flexible policies and a consumer-like user experience to permit organizations to easily allow customers or partners to sign in to their applications with their existing identity information. Single Sign-On also enables built-in reporting and analytics that provide real-time search functionalities across users, devices, applications and the associated access and usage activity.•Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication.  Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication is a comprehensive, but simple-to-use, product that provides an additional layer of security for an organization’s cloud, mobile and web applications and data. We offer an intelligent approach to security, built on contextual data. Adaptive Multi-7Factor Authentication includes a policy framework that is integrated with a broad set of cloud and on-premise applications and network infrastructures. It offers adaptive, risk-based authentication that leverages data intelligence from across the Okta network of thousands of organizations.•Lifecycle Management.  Lifecycle Management enables IT organizations or developers to manage a user's identity throughout its entire lifecycle. It automates IT processes and ensures user accounts are created and deactivated at the appropriate times, including the workflow and policies needed to power those processes. With Okta Lifecycle Management, organizations can securely manage the entire identity lifecycle, from on-boarding to off-boarding, and ensure compliance requirements are met as user roles evolve and access levels change.•API Access Management.  API Access Management enables organizations to secure APIs as systems connect to each other. Access to these APIs is managed based on the user, which enables organizations to centrally maintain one set of permissions for any employee, partner or customer across every point of access. API Access Management reduces development time, boosts security and enables seamless end-user experiences by providing a unified portable service for authorizing secure and always available access to any API.By focusing on identity, the one constant in an ever-changing technology and threat landscape, the Okta Identity Cloud provides our customers with a solution to solve their IT and security challenges, and facilitates their adoption of a Zero Trust security model.Our TechnologyWe focus on engineering an intuitive, but comprehensive, platform to solve complex problems. Our pure cloud architecture is multi-tenant, encrypted and third-party validated. Our service also allows us to integrate into our customers’ on-premise components and hybrid configurations.Okta Integration NetworkThe Okta Integration Network contains over 6,000 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure providers, including Amazon Web Services, Atlassian, Box, Cisco, Citrix, F5 Networks, Google Cloud, Microsoft, NetSuite, Palo Alto Networks, SailPoint, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Slack, Splunk, VMware, Workday and Zoom. At the core of the Okta Integration Network is a patented technology that allows our customers to seamlessly connect to any application or type of device that is already integrated into our network. One Platform with Differentiated Administration, User and Developer ExperienceThe Okta Identity Cloud is built on one common platform and user interface framework, offering administrators and users a consistent, easy-to-use, consumer-like experience across our products. Our technology integrates with industry-leading browsers and mobile applications to provide seamless access to nearly any web or native mobile application. We also heavily leverage operating system management and security technologies across desktops, laptops and mobile devices to provide a transparent, but secure experience for users across a range of devices. These integrations allow us to seamlessly deliver connectivity use cases that previously required significant custom development to achieve.Robust SecuritySecurity is a mission-critical issue for Okta and for our customers. Our approach to security spans day-to-day operational practices to the design and development of our software to how customer data is segmented and secured within our multi-tenant platform. We ensure that access to our platform is securely delegated across an organization. Our source code is updated weekly, and there are audited and verifiable security checkpoints to ensure source code fidelity and continuous security review. We have attained SOC 2 Type II, CSA Star Level 2 Attestation, ISO/IEC 27001:2013, ISO/IEC 27018:2014 and HIPAA certifications and multiple agency FedRAMP Moderate Authorities to Operate.  We also support FIPS 140-2 validated encryption in our Okta Verify MFA product.Scalability and UptimeOur technical operations and engineering teams are designed around the concept of an always-on, highly redundant and available platform that we can upgrade without customer disruption. Our products and architecture were built entirely in and for the cloud with availability and scalability at the center of the design, and were built to be agnostic with respect to the underlying infrastructure. Our maintenance windows do not require any downtime.8Our proprietary cell architecture includes redundant, active-active availability zones with cross-continental disaster recovery centers, real-time database replication and geo-distributed storage. If one of our systems goes down, another is quickly promoted. Our architecture is designed to scale both vertically by increasing the size of the application tiers and horizontally by adding new geo-distributed cells.Our platform is monitored not only at the infrastructure level but also at the application and third-party integration level. Synthetic transaction monitoring allows our technical operations team to detect and resolve issues proactively. Our CustomersAs of January 31, 2019, we had over 6,100 customers on our platform. Our customers span nearly all industry verticals and range from small organizations with fewer than 100 employees to companies in the Fortune 100, with up to hundreds of thousands of employees, some of which use the Okta Identity Cloud to manage millions of their customers' identities.Sales and MarketingSalesWe sell directly to customers through our inside and field sales force and also indirectly through our extensive ecosystem of channel partners. Once a sale is made, we leverage our land-and-expand sales model to generate incremental revenue, often within the term of the initial agreement, through the addition of new users and the sale of additional products. In many instances, we find that initial customer success with our platform results in key internal decision makers expanding their deployments, for example, from initial use for workforce identity to expanded use for their customer identity needs. Furthermore, as our customers are successful in their businesses and increase headcount or the number of their customers, we share in their growth as the number of identities that we manage increases.Our sales organization is structured to address the specific needs of each segment of our target market. Our sales team is divided by geography, customer size and industry vertical. Our direct sales force is supported by our sales engineers, security team, cloud architects, professional services team and other technical resources.We benefit from an expansive partner ecosystem that helps drive additional sales. Nearly all of the leading cloud application providers are our partners, and many of them drive further customer acquisition for us through co-selling arrangements, building our offerings directly into their products, and product demonstrations running on the Okta Identity Cloud. We also partner with several of the large technology companies that are driving the movement to the cloud. In addition to these technology partners, we leverage our channel partners, including system integrators, traditional VARs and Government VARs, to broaden the range of customers we reach.MarketingOur most valuable marketing features our customers and their successes, and is informed by a deeply data-driven approach, giving us insights into the efficacy of our efforts. Our marketing efforts focus on promoting our industry-leading identity platform, establishing our brand, generating awareness, creating sales leads and cultivating the Okta Community.A centerpiece of our marketing strategy is our annual customer conference, Oktane, that features customers sharing their success stories, new product and feature announcements and hands-on product labs.Research and DevelopmentOur research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, creation and the quality of the Okta Identity Cloud. The research and development organization also works closely with our technical operations team to ensure the successful deployment and monitoring of our platform. We utilize test automation and application monitoring to ensure the Okta Identity Cloud is always-on. Customer Support and Professional ServicesOur products are designed for ease of use and fast deployments. As part of our customer first strategy, we are focused on customer success and offer several programs to help our customers maximize their success with our products. These programs leverage the expertise and best practices that we have built while helping thousands of Okta customers to adopt and deploy our products.9Customer Support and Training ServicesWe offer three tiers of support, each of which builds upon the previous tier. We provide live webinars as well as on-demand instructional videos to provide our customers with information about product features, functionality and our most common customer use cases.Professional ServicesOur professional services team provides assistance to customers in the deployment of the Okta Identity Cloud and includes identity and security experts, customized deployment plans and SmartStart, which provides a quick path to implementation.Okta CommunityWe have created the Okta Community, an online community available to all of our customers that enables them to connect with other customers and partners to ask questions and find answers.Intellectual PropertyWe protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology.As of January 31, 2019, we had thirteen issued patents in the United States, which expire between 2030 and 2036 and cover various aspects of our products. In addition, as of such date, we also had three issued patents in Australia, which expire between 2033 and 2035, and two issued patents in New Zealand expiring in 2034 and 2035.We have registered “Okta” as a trademark in the United States, the European Community, Australia, Canada and Japan. We also have filed other trademark applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions.We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Okta” and similar variations.In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. Our employees, consultants and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both general and product-specific terms of use.Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our CompetitorsOur competitors in the workforce identity market include: •Authentication providers, such as Computer Associates (a subsidiary of Broadcom), Duo Security (a division of Cisco Systems), IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SailPoint; •Lifecycle Management providers, such as Computer Associates (a subsidiary of Broadcom), IBM, Microsoft and Oracle; and•Multi-factor Authentication providers, such as Duo Security (a division of Cisco Systems), Microsoft, RSA (a division of Dell Technologies) and Symantec.

We believe our product strategy, technology and company culture allow us to compete favorably on each of these factors.We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true as we are a cloud-based offering, and our competitors may also seek to acquire new offerings or repurpose their existing offerings to provide identity management solutions with subscription models.With the continuing merger and acquisition activity in the technology industry, particularly transactions involving security or identity and access management technologies, there is a greater likelihood that we will compete with other large technology companies in the future in both the workforce identity and customer identity markets. Many of our competitors, particularly the large technology companies named above, have substantial competitive advantages such as significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution, customer support or other resources, longer operating histories, greater resources to make strategic acquisitions and greater name recognition than we do. However, we believe that our platform architecture, position as an independent provider of identity solutions and focus on innovation enable us to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than our larger competitors that primarily focus on other market segments and tie their identity solutions to their other proprietary products.Additional information regarding our competition is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Okta for GoodOkta for Good’s mission is to mobilize our technology and people to enable non-profit organizations to achieve their missions faster.

Once a sale is made, we leverage our land-and-expand sales model to generate incremental revenue, often within the term of the initial agreement, through the addition of new users and the sale of additional products. In many instances, we find that initial customer success with our platform results in key internal decision makers expanding their deployments, for example, from initial use for workforce identity to expanded use for their customer identity needs. Furthermore, as our customers are successful in their businesses and increase headcount or the number of their customers, we share in their growth as the number of identities that we manage increases.Our sales organization is structured to address the specific needs of each segment of our target market. Our sales team is divided by geography, customer size and industry vertical. Our direct sales force is supported by our sales engineers, security team, cloud architects, professional services team and other technical resources.We benefit from an expansive partner ecosystem that helps drive additional sales. Nearly all of the leading cloud application providers are our partners, and many of them drive further customer acquisition for us through co-selling arrangements, building our offerings directly into their products, and product demonstrations running on the Okta Identity Cloud.

We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both general and product-specific terms of use.Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our CompetitorsThe markets for our products are rapidly evolving, highly competitive and subject to shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new competing technologies. As the markets in which we operate continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter those markets, we expect competition to intensify. Our competitor categories include: •Authentication providers; •Lifecycle Management providers;•Multi-factor Authentication providers;. •Infrastructure-as-a-service providers;10•Other customer identity and access management providers; and•Solutions developed in-house by our potential customers.We compete with both cloud-based and on-premise enterprise application software providers. Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered. However, many of our competitors have substantial competitive advantages such as significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution, customer support or other resources, longer operating histories, greater resources to make strategic acquisitions and greater name recognition than we do. Our principal competitor is Microsoft.Due to the flexibility and breadth of our platform, we can and often do co-exist alongside our competitors’ products within our customer base.Principal competitive factors in our markets include flexibility, independence, product capabilities, total cost of ownership, time to value, scalability, user experience, number of pre-built integrations, customer satisfaction, global reach and ease of integration, management and use. We believe our product strategy, platform architecture, technology and independence as well as our company culture allow us to compete favorably on each of these factors.We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true as we are a cloud-based offering, and our competitors may also seek to acquire new offerings or repurpose their existing offerings to provide identity management solutions with subscription models. With the continuing merger and acquisition activity in the technology industry, particularly transactions involving security or identity and access management technologies, there is a greater likelihood that we will compete with other large technology companies in the future in both the workforce identity and customer identity markets. Additional information regarding our competition is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Okta for GoodOkta for Good’s mission is to mobilize our technology and people to enable non-profit organizations to achieve their missions faster.

2021-03-04T21:02:41Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1660134,"Item 1. Business OverviewOkta is the leading independent identity management platform for the enterprise. Our vision is to enable everyone to safely use any technology, and we believe identity is the key to making that happen. Our mission is to bring simple and secure digital access to people and organizations everywhere. The Okta Identity Cloud is powered by our category-defining platform that enables our customers to securely connect the right people to the right technologies and services at the right time.The Okta Identity Cloud helps organizations effectively harness the power of cloud, mobile and web technologies by securing users and connecting them with the applications and technology they use. We designed the Okta Identity Cloud to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing every identity in an organization. Every day, thousands of organizations and millions of people use Okta to securely access a wide range of cloud, mobile and web applications, on-premises servers, application program interfaces (APIs), IT infrastructure providers and services from a multitude of devices. Developers leverage our platform to securely and efficiently embed identity into the software they build, allowing them to focus on their core mission. Employees and contractors sign into the Okta Identity Cloud to seamlessly and securely access the applications they need to do their most important work. Organizations use our platform to collaborate with their partners, and to provide their customers with more modern and secure experiences online and via mobile devices. As we add new customers, users, developers and integrations to our platform, our business, customers, partners and users benefit from powerful network effects that increase the value and security of the Okta Identity Cloud.The acceleration of digital transformations, cloud modernization and changing consumer expectations to simple, secure digital experiences are driving a shift in how organizations manage consumer identities on the internet. Organizations are building secure consumer-facing applications and are turning to identity to optimize seamless and private user experiences. Our approach provides organizations with the scale, efficiency and security they need to build customer facing applications. Given the growth trends in the number of applications and cloud adoption, and the movement to remote workforces, identity is becoming the most critical layer of an organization’s security. As organizations shift from network-based security models to a Zero Trust security model focusing on adaptive and context-aware controls, identity has become the most reliable way to manage user access and protect digital assets. Our approach to identity allows our customers to simplify and efficiently scale their security infrastructures across internal IT systems and external customer facing applications. We designed the Okta Identity Cloud to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing all of their identities. Our platform allows our customers to easily provision their customers, employees, contractors, and partners, enabling any user to connect to any device, cloud or application, all with a simple, intuitive and consumer-like user experience.As of January 31, 2021, more than 10,000 customers across nearly every industry used the Okta Identity Cloud to secure and manage identities around the world. Our customers consist of leading global organizations ranging from the largest enterprises, to small and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits and government agencies. We partner with leading application, infrastructure and security vendors, such as Amazon Web Services, Cisco, CrowdStrike, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Netskope, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware and Workday. We had over 7,000 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure providers as of January 31, 2021, which while not directly correlated to revenue, shows the breadth and acceptance of our platform.We employ a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model, and generate revenue primarily by selling multi-year subscriptions to our cloud-based offerings. We focus on acquiring and retaining our customers and increasing their spending with us through expanding the number of users who access the Okta Identity Cloud and up-selling additional products. We sell our products directly through our field and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners, including resellers, system integrators and other distribution partners.5On March 3, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Auth0, Inc. (Auth0) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement). Upon consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, all outstanding shares of Auth0 capital stock, options, warrants, convertible securities, phantom equity and other outstanding equity interests will be cancelled in exchange for aggregate consideration of $6.5 billion in the form of shares of Class A common stock of the Company and assumed awards of corresponding Company equity interests, subject to customary purchase price adjustments and certain customary cash payouts in lieu of shares of Company Class A common stock, as provided by the Merger Agreement. The purchase price payable in shares of Class A common stock will be valued at $276.2147 per share (which price was calculated based on the daily volume-weighted average sales price per share of Company Class A common stock for the 20 trading days ending on February 26, 2021). The per share price of these shares has been fixed as of the Merger Agreement signing date, and the aggregate value of these shares will fluctuate based on changes in our share price between the signing and closing dates.Auth0 is an identity management platform for application developers that provides solutions to add authorization and authentication services to developer applications. The proposed transaction is expected to close during the Company’s second quarter of fiscal 2022, the quarter ending July 31, 2021. The closing of this transaction is subject to certain customary closing conditions and approvals.The Okta Identity CloudThe Okta Identity Cloud is an independent and neutral cloud-based identity solution that allows our customers to integrate with nearly any application, service or cloud that they choose through our secure, reliable and scalable platform and cloud infrastructure. Our technological neutrality allows our customers to easily adopt the best technologies, and our platform is designed to securely connect users to the technology that they choose. We prioritize the compatibility of the Okta Identity Cloud with public clouds, on-premises infrastructures and hybrid clouds. Our customers use the Okta Identity Cloud to secure their workforces, to create solutions that make their partner networks more collaborative, and to provide more seamless and secure experiences for their customers or end users, which combined with our open approach, enables our customers to future-proof their environments.The Okta Identity Cloud can be used as the central system for an organization’s connectivity, access, authentication and identity lifecycle management needs spanning all of its users, technology and applications.We enable our customers to easily deploy, manage and secure applications and devices, and to provision and support users across their IT environments, with a simple, intuitive, consumer-like user experience. Developers are similarly able to leverage a robust set of tools through the platform to quickly build custom cloud, mobile and web application experiences that leverage the breadth and depth of capabilities within the Okta Identity Cloud. Once deployed, we enable administrators to enforce contextual access management decisions based on conditions such as user identity, device, location, application identity, IP reputation and time of day.The Okta Identity Cloud is used by organizations in two distinct and powerful ways. Our customers use it to manage and secure their employees, contractors and partners, which we refer to as workforce identity. Our customers also use it to enable, manage and secure the identities of their own customers via the powerful APIs we have developed, which we refer to as customer identity. The Okta Identity Cloud is underpinned by Okta Platform Services which are the foundational platform components that power our product features. The Okta Identity Cloud for Workforce IdentityIn workforce identity use cases, the Okta Identity Cloud simplifies the way an organization’s employees, contractors and partners connect to its applications and data from any device, while increasing efficiency and keeping IT environments secure. We enable organizations to provide their workforces with immediate and secure access to every application they need from any device they use, without requiring multiple credentials, which significantly enhances user connectivity and productivity. We offer our customers an additional security layer through our Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication product. Our Universal Directory product also serves as a system of record to help our customers organize, customize and manage their users. Our Lifecycle Management product enables customers to manage users’ access privileges through their entire lifecycle with a no-code approach that improves administrative efficiency and productivity. Our Advanced Server Access product is designed to significantly improve our customers’ ability to secure access to cloud-based and on-premises servers, while Okta Access Gateway enables our customers to extend the Okta Identity Cloud to their existing on-premises applications. The Okta Identity Cloud enables our customers to automate access across their growing ecosystem of employees, contractors and partners, increasing collaboration across their workforces.6The Okta Identity Cloud for Customer IdentityIn customer identity use cases, the Okta Identity Cloud enables organizations to transform their own customers’ experiences by empowering development teams to rapidly and securely build customer-facing cloud, mobile or web applications. We enable an organization’s product team to layer our powerful identity platform into their cloud, web and mobile applications. This makes it easier for them to authenticate, manage, scale and secure their connections, enabling rapid time to market for the business. Organizations are able to centrally manage policy and API-level access across all their applications, leading to more seamless customer experiences that are personalized, engaging and secure.Okta Platform ServicesIn order to enable customers and partners to address a wide range of identity use cases, we have built a set of modular components, called Okta Platform Services, which can be combined to build new features and tailored experiences faster. Okta Platform Services are available in Okta packaged products through APIs and software development kits (SDKs). Okta Platform Services can be used across both workforce and customer identity use cases. We expect to use Okta Platform Services to continue to enable new and expanded use cases and enable customers or third-party developers to build their own solutions based on an industry use case or unique customer need. Okta Platform Services include Okta’s Identity Engine, Workflows, Devices, Integrations and Insights.

Once a sale is made, we leverage our land-and-expand sales model to generate incremental revenue, often within the term of the initial agreement, through the addition of new users and the sale of additional products. In many instances, we find that initial customer success with our platform results in key internal decision makers expanding their deployments, for example, from initial use for workforce identity to expanded use for their customer identity needs. Furthermore, as our customers are successful in their businesses and increase headcount or the number of their customers, we share in their growth as the number of identities that we manage increases.Our sales organization is structured to address the specific needs of each segment of our target market. Our sales team is divided by geography, customer size and industry vertical. Our direct sales force is supported by our sales engineers, security team, cloud architects, professional services team and other technical resources.We benefit from an expansive partner ecosystem that helps drive additional sales. Nearly all of the leading cloud application providers are our partners, and many of them drive further customer acquisition for us through co-selling arrangements, building our offerings directly into their products, and product demonstrations running on the Okta Identity Cloud. We also partner with several of the large technology companies that are driving the movement to the cloud. In addition to these technology partners, we leverage our channel partners, including system integrators, traditional VARs and Government VARs, to broaden the range of customers we reach.MarketingOur most valuable marketing features our customers and their successes, and is informed by a deeply data-driven approach, giving us insights into the efficacy of our efforts.

As the markets in which we operate continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter those markets, we expect competition to intensify. Our competitor categories include: •Authentication providers; •Lifecycle Management providers;•Multi-factor Authentication providers;. •Infrastructure-as-a-service providers;•Other customer identity and access management providers; and•Solutions developed in-house by our potential customers.We compete with both cloud-based and on-premise enterprise application software providers. Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered. However, many of our competitors have substantial competitive advantages such as significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution, customer support or other resources, longer operating histories, greater resources to make strategic acquisitions and greater name recognition than we do. Our principal competitor is Microsoft.Due to the flexibility and breadth of our platform, we can and often do co-exist alongside our competitors’ products within our customer base.Principal competitive factors in our markets include flexibility, independence, product capabilities, total cost of ownership, time to value, scalability, user experience, number of pre-built integrations, customer satisfaction, global reach and ease of integration, management and use. We believe our product strategy, platform architecture, technology and independence as well as our company culture allow us to compete favorably on each of these factors.We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true as we are a cloud-based offering, and our competitors may also seek to acquire new offerings or repurpose their existing offerings to provide identity management solutions with subscription models. With the continuing merger and acquisition activity in the technology industry, particularly transactions involving security or identity and access management technologies, there is a greater likelihood that we will compete with other large technology companies in the future in both the workforce identity and customer identity markets.

2019-09-18T21:17:24Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1713683,"Item 1. BusinessOverviewZscaler’s mission is to provide fast, secure and reliable access to information no matter where it lives. We were incorporated in 2007, during the early stages of cloud adoption and mobility, based on a vision that the internet would become the new corporate network as the cloud becomes the new data center. We predicted that with rapid cloud adoption and increasing workforce mobility, traditional perimeter security approaches would provide inadequate protection for users and data and an increasingly poor user experience. We pioneered a security cloud that represents a fundamental shift in the architectural design and approach to network security. Enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud to achieve greater IT agility, a faster pace of innovation and lower costs. Organizations are increasingly relying on internet destinations for a range of business activities, adopting new external SaaS applications for critical business functions and moving their internally managed applications to the public cloud, or IaaS. Enterprise users now expect to be able to seamlessly access applications and data, wherever they are hosted, from any device, anywhere in the world. We believe these trends are indicative of the broader digital transformation agenda, as businesses increasingly succeed or fail based on their IT outcomes. We believe that securing the on-premises corporate network to protect users and data is becoming increasingly irrelevant in a cloud and mobile-first world where organizations depend on the internet, a network they do not control and cannot secure, to access critical applications that power their businesses. We pioneered a new approach to security that connects the right user to the right application, regardless of network. Our cloud platform, which delivers security as a service, eliminates the need for traditional on-premises security appliances that are difficult to maintain and require compromises between security, cost and user experience. Our cloud platform incorporates the security functionality needed to enable users to safely utilize authorized applications and services based on an organization’s policies. Our solution is a purpose-built, multi-tenant, distributed cloud security platform that secures access for users and devices to applications and services, regardless of location. Before our platform, the corporate data center served as the central hub of IT security, with a physical network perimeter used to separate corporate users, devices and applications from the internet. Today, the network perimeter consists of appliances that have become fundamentally less effective as applications, data, users and devices rapidly move off the corporate network, making the notion of a corporate perimeter obsolete. In a world where more companies are shifting their most critical IT assets to the cloud, cloud-first security is required. Our architecture is vastly different from the traditional “hub-and-spoke” corporate perimeter, where traffic from branch offices is routed to centralized data centers for security scanning and policy enforcement before reaching its destination. In contrast, our security cloud sits between an organization’s users and devices, and the internet, inspecting traffic on a direct path to the destination. Our solutions enable customers to set policies that follow users, so a consistent level of protection is applied no matter where users are located or how they are connected to the internet. We provide all of this security at scale, processing approximately 70 billion internet requests per day. Our platform eliminates the need for organizations to buy and manage a variety of appliances that need to be maintained by a large number of highly skilled security personnel, who are expensive and in increasingly short supply. Our multi-tenant architecture is distributed across over 150 data centers globally, which allows us to secure users across 185 countries. Each day, we block over 100 million threats and perform over 120,000 unique security updates. Our customers benefit from the network effect of our growing cloud because once a new threat is detected, it can be blocked for users across our entire customer base within minutes. 3Table of ContentsOur customers protect their users by routing their internet traffic through our cloud platform. Some of the largest enterprises and government agencies in the world rely on our solutions to help them accelerate their move to the cloud. We have over 3,900 customers across all major geographies, with an emphasis on larger organizations, and we currently count over 400 of the Forbes Global 2000 as customers. Our customers span every major industry, including airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services. We have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing from $125.7 million in fiscal 2017 to $190.2 million in fiscal 2018 to $302.8 million in fiscal 2019, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 51% and 59%, respectively. We experienced net losses of $28.7 million, $33.6 million and $35.5 million in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.Our Solutions and Platform Our purpose-built cloud security platform offers two principal services built natively in the cloud.Zscaler Internet Access Our Zscaler Internet Access solution, or ZIA, was designed to securely connect users to externally managed applications, including SaaS applications and internet destinations regardless of device, location or network. Our ZIA solution provides inline content inspection and firewall access controls across all ports and protocols to protect organizations and users from external threats as well as protecting an organization’s data from leaking out. Policies follow the user to provide identical protection on any device, regardless of location; any policy changes are enforced for users worldwide. Our cloud security platform provides full inline content inspection of webpages to assess and correlate the risk of webpage objects, continuously discovering and blocking sophisticated threats. Our ZIA solution includes broad functionality, which we categorize by three areas: Access Control The access control functionality of our ZIA solution enforces access and usage policies to externally managed applications, including SaaS application and internet destinations. This provides functionality that has traditionally been provided by stand-alone point products. •Cloud Firewall: Our cloud firewall was designed to protect users by inspecting internet traffic on all ports and protocols, and it offers user level policies, application identification with deep packet inspection and intrusion prevention. •URL Filtering: Our URL filtering capability enables customers to enforce acceptable usage policies and protects organizations from users visiting unauthorized websites or illegally downloading content that can increase liability and impact their brand. •Bandwidth Control: Our bandwidth control and traffic shaping capabilities ensure that business critical applications are prioritized over non-business critical applications, improving productivity and user experience. By enforcing quality of service in the cloud, our platform can optimize “last-mile” utilization of a customer’s network, providing significant value. •DNS Filtering: Our Domain Name System, or DNS,  filtering solution provides a local DNS resolver and enforces acceptable use policies. 4Table of ContentsThreat Prevention Our second area of functionality, threat prevention, protects users from threats using a range of approaches and techniques. Our robust threat prevention capabilities provide multiple layers of protection to prevent cyberattacks. We provide functionality that traditionally has been offered by disparate, stand-alone products. •Advanced Threat Protection: Our advanced protection solution delivers real-time protection from malicious internet content like browser exploits, scripts, zero-pixel iFrames, malware and botnet callbacks. Over 120,000 unique security updates are performed every day to the Zscaler cloud to keep users protected. Once we detect a new threat to a user, we block it for all users. We call this the “cloud security effect.” •Cloud Sandbox: Our cloud sandbox enables enterprises to block zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats, or APTs, by analyzing unknown files for malicious behavior, and it can scale to every user regardless of location. Our sandbox was designed and built to be multi-tenant and allows customers to determine which traffic should be sent to the cloud sandbox. As an integrated cloud security platform, customers can set policies by users and destinations to prevent patient-zero scenarios by holding, detonating and analyzing suspicious files in the sandbox before being sent to the user. •Anti-Virus: Our anti-virus technology uses a signature database of files and objects on the internet known to be unsafe and runs traffic through multiple anti-virus engines in a single pass. •DNS Security: Our DNS security blocks access to known malicious sites, including command and control sites, and routes suspicious traffic to our threat detection engines for content inspection. Data Protection Our third area of functionality, data protection, prevents unauthorized sharing or exfiltration of confidential information, reducing our customers’ business and compliance risk. •Data Loss Protection: Our data loss protection enables enterprises to use standard or custom dictionaries using efficient pattern-matching algorithms to easily scale to all users and traffic, including compressed or encrypted traffic, to prevent, monitor or block unauthorized or sensitive data exfiltration. Our exact data match or EDM functionality significantly improves the accuracy and efficacy of our data loss prevention solution by enabling our customers to populate a custom database scaling to billions of unique fields. These fields may contain, for example, personally identifiable information like credit card or social security numbers, that our customers want to protect. •Cloud Application Control: Our cloud application control allows enterprises to discover and granularly control user access to known and unknown cloud applications. By doing SSL interception at scale, we provide malware protection, data loss prevention and similar Cloud Access Security Broker, or CASB, functions that can be performed inline, for specific sanctioned applications. Business policies can be defined with granular access control for specified cloud applications, such as the ability to upload or download files or post comments or videos based on different user or group identity. We partner with specific CASB vendors to extend their policy controls and visibility of out-of-band cloud applications. •File Type Controls: Our file type control allows policies to be defined that control which file types are allowed to be downloaded and uploaded based on application, user, location and destination. 5Table of ContentsZscaler Private Access Our Zscaler Private Access solution, or ZPA, was designed to provide secure access to internally managed applications, either hosted internally in data centers, private or public clouds. Our ZPA solution was designed around four key tenants that fundamentally change the way users access internal applications: •connect users to applications without bringing users on the network; •never expose applications to the internet; •segment access to applications without relying on traditional approach of network segmentation; and •provide remote access over the internet without virtual private networks, or VPNs.Our ZPA solution enforces a global policy engine that manages access to internally managed applications regardless of location. If access is granted to a user, our ZPA solution connects the user’s device only to the authorized application without exposing the identity or location of the application. Hence applications are not exposed to the internet, further limiting threat exposure. This results in reduced cost and complexity, while offering better security and an improved user experience. ZPA functionality falls in three major areas: •Secure Application Access: Our ZPA solution delivers seamless connectivity to internally managed applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, enterprise data center, or both. Administrators can set global policies from a single console, enabling policy-driven access that is agnostic to the network the users are on. By creating seamless access to applications regardless of a user’s network, our ZPA solution subsumes the need for traditional remote access VPNs, Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, VPNs, reverse proxies and other similar products. •Application Segmentation: This fundamentally new architecture provides capabilities that enable user and application level segmentation, a vast improvement over traditional network segmentation. As each user-to-application connection is segmented with microtunnels, each of which is a temporary session between a specific user and a specific application, lateral movement across the network is prevented which significantly reduces security risk. Similar to CASB application discovery reports for internet applications, our ZPA solution provides granular discovery of internally managed applications to aid the creation of segmentation policies. Because our ZPA solution sits on the application layer and is name- or domain-based, organizations can quickly and easily identify the internally-managed applications that are running and then easily provision appropriate policies. Microtunnels subsume the need for internal firewalls, which are required for protecting against lateral malware propagation from machine to machine, and traditional network access control functionality since users are granted access only to applications for which they have permission and are not granted full access to the network. •Application Protection: Our ZPA solution initiates and connects together outbound-only links between authenticated users and internally managed applications using microtunnels. Access is provided to users without bringing them onto the corporate network and without exposing applications to the internet. Internally managed applications are not discoverable or identifiable. With no inbound connections and no public IP addresses, there is no inbound attack surface and therefore no threat of distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks. With our innovative approach, we subsume the need for a next-generation firewall. Similarly, by completely removing the need for an exposed IP address or DNS to the internet, we subsume the functionality of DDoS mitigation systems. 6Table of ContentsThe primary use cases for our ZPA solution includes: •VPN replacement; •providing non-employees with secure access to internal applications; •direct-to-cloud access to internally managed applications hosted in public cloud environments, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform; and •access to applications following a merger or acquisition by providing named users with access to named applications, without the need to merge networks. Our Technology and Architecture Zscaler is driven by technology and innovation. We developed a highly scalable, multi-tenant, globally distributed cloud capable of providing inline inspection that offers a full range of enterprise network security services. We designed and built a purpose-built three-tier architecture starting with our core operating system and adding layers of security and networking innovations over time. Our cloud platform is protected by more than 130 issued and pending patents. Our cloud is distributed across more than 150 data centers on five continents and processes approximately 70 billion requests per day from users across 185 countries. The platform is designed to be resilient, redundant and high-performing. Our platform is built as software modules that run on standard x86 platforms without any dependency on custom hardware. The platform modules are split into the control plane (Zscaler Central Authority), the enforcement plane (Zscaler Enforcement Nodes) and the logging and statistics plane (Zscaler Nanolog Servers) as described below:•Zscaler Central Authority: The Zscaler Central Authority monitors our entire security cloud and provides a central location for software and database updates, policy and configuration settings and threat intelligence. The collection of Zscaler Central Authority instances together act like the brain of the cloud, and they are geographically distributed for redundancy and performance. •Zscaler Enforcement Nodes: Customer traffic gets directed to the nearest Zscaler Enforcement Node, where security, management and compliance policies served by the Zscaler Central Authority are enforced. The Zscaler Enforcement Node also incorporates our differentiated authentication and policy distribution mechanism that enables any user to connect to any Zscaler Enforcement Node at any time to ensure full policy enforcement. The Zscaler Enforcement Node utilizes a full proxy architecture and is built to ensure data is not written to disk to maintain the highest level of data security. Data is scanned in RAM only and then erased. Logs are continuously created in memory and forwarded to our logging module. •Zscaler Nanolog Servers: Our Nanolog technology is built into the Zscaler Enforcement Node to perform lossless compression of logs, enabling our platform to collect over 70 terabytes of unique raw log data every day. Logs are transmitted to our Nanolog Servers over secure connections and multicast to multiple servers for redundancy. Our dashboards provide visibility into our customer’s traffic to enable troubleshooting, policy changes and other administrative actions. Our analytics capabilities allow customers to interactively mine billions of transaction logs to generate reports that provide insight on network utilization and traffic. We do not rely on batch reporting; we continuously update our dashboards and reporting and can stream logs to a third-party Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM, service as they arrive. Regardless of where users are located, customers can choose to have logs stored in the United States, the European Union or Switzerland. 7Table of ContentsOur platform is a critical integration point positioned in the data path providing secure access to the internet, cloud and internal applications. We complement and interoperate with key technology vendors across major market segments, including software-defined networking in a wide area network, or SD-WAN, identity and access management, device and endpoint management, as well as SIEM for reporting and analytics. Many of these vendors, like us, were developed in the cloud and together provide a foundation for a modern access and security architecture. Growth Strategies The growing use of the internet and the increasing adoption of the cloud and mobility are driving network and application transformation. As a provider of a fully integrated, multi-tenant cloud security solution, we enable our customers to accelerate this secure transformation to the cloud and believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize value as they undertake these transitions. Key elements of our growth strategy include: •Continue to win new customers. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand our customer base, both in the United States and internationally. We have invested significantly in our sales and marketing organization to execute against this opportunity. •Expand in existing customers. We plan to leverage a land-and-expand approach with our existing customers to sell subscriptions to additional users, additional suites that contain more functionality and a la carte services. •Leverage channel partners to participate in cloud transformation initiatives. We have invested in establishing long-standing relationships with global telecommunications service providers and are expanding our network of global system integrators and regional telecommunications service providers.•Expansion and innovation of services. We continue to invest in research and development and acquire new technologies and products in order to add new and differentiated solutions to our existing product portfolio and to improve the overall functionality, reliability, availability and scalability of our cloud security platform. •Expansion into additional market segments. We are targeting the expansion of our immediate addressable market, emphasizing U.S. federal government agencies in the near- to medium-term as well as additional international markets such as Japan and the Asia Pacific region.•Extend our platform to third-party developers. We intend to open our cloud security platform to third-party developers and vendors to offer new functionality and solutions that may target specific use cases, verticals and niche requirements.Our Customers We sell to enterprises of all sizes. As of July 31, 2019, we had over 3,900 customers, including over 400 of the Forbes Global 2000. Many of our customers include major global enterprises that send virtually all of their internet traffic through our cloud security platform. Our customers operate in a variety of industries, including airlines and transportation, conglomerates consumer goods and retail, financial services, health-care, manufacturing, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services. Approximately 51% of our revenue in fiscal 2019, 55% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 and 54% of our revenue in fiscal 2017 was from customers outside the United States. No customer contributed more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017.8Table of ContentsSales and MarketingAlthough we have a channel sales model, we use a joint sales approach in which our sales force develops relationships directly with our customers, and together with our channel account teams, works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. Our customer care and success teams maintain high-touch relationships with our customers to deploy and manage our cloud platform, identify, analyze and resolve performance issues and respond to security threats. We believe customer service touchpoints are opportunities to further develop our relationship with our customers and potentially generate incremental revenue through the addition of new users and services. Our channel partners consist of global telecommunications service provider, system integrator and value-added reseller partners, and we leverage their relationships to expand our reach, improve procurement and accelerate customer fulfillment. We enter into agreements with our channel partners in the ordinary course of business. The contracts typically have a one-year term and renew automatically, subject to cancellation by either party upon 90 days’ notice. These agreements contain standard commercial terms and conditions, including payment terms, billing frequency, warranties and indemnification. Our channel partners generally place purchase orders with us after receiving orders from customers. We generally maintain privity of contract with customers through end user subscription agreements. We expect to continue investing in our channel partners as we provide them with education, training and programs, including supporting their independent sales of our solutions. We believe that such investment, and investments in our sales force, will lead to significant expansion in our customer base, which will materially impact our business and results of operations. Our marketing strategy is focused on platform and brand awareness, which drives our opportunity pipeline and customer demand. This strategy is account-based, enabling us to pursue targeted marketing activities across both digital and non-digital channels. We anticipate increasing our marketing team headcount and are investing in programs designed to elevate our brand in the market and engage new enterprise accounts. We also participate in a number of cloud and security industry events. In addition, we have a deeply integrated ecosystem of channel partners, with whom we engage in joint marketing activities. Data Center Operations We operate our services across more than 150 data centers around the world, which are built to be highly resilient, have multiple levels of redundancy and provide failover to other data centers in our network. Our data centers are co-located within top-tier internet interconnection hubs that have direct connectivity, known as peering, to major telecommunication service providers, SaaS providers, public cloud providers, internet content providers and popular internet destinations. A number of our data centers are also located with our service provider partners. Our platform has received ISO 27001 certification since 2014. Research and Development Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, operation and quality of our cloud platform. In addition to improving on our features, functionality and scalability, this organization works closely with our cloud operations team to ensure that our platform is reliable, available and scalable. ThreatLabZ, our internal team of security experts, researchers and network engineers, analyzes the global threat landscape, works to eliminate threats across our cloud platform and reports on emerging security issues. 9Table of ContentsResearch and development expense was $62.0 million, $39.4 million and $33.6 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Our research and development leadership team is based in San Jose, California, and we also maintain research and development centers in India and Canada. Competition The market for security solutions is defined by changing technologies, an evolving threat landscape and complex enterprise needs. Our competitors and potential competitors include legacy on-premises appliance vendors across a number of categories: •independent IT security vendors, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., Fortinet, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and Symantec Corporation, which offer a broad mix of network and endpoint security products; •large networking vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. and Juniper Networks, Inc., which offer security appliances and incorporate security capabilities in their networking products; •companies such as FireEye, Inc., Forcepoint Inc. (previously, Websense, Inc.), F5 Networks, Inc. and Pulse Secure, LLC with point solutions that compete with some of the features of our cloud platform, such as proxy, firewall, sandboxing and advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, encryption, load balancing and VPN; and •other providers of IT security services that offer, or may leverage related technologies to introduce, products that compete with or are alternatives to our cloud platform. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include: •delivering security from the cloud regardless of location of the user; •platform features, effectiveness and extensibility; •platform reliability, availability and scalability; •rapid development and delivery of new capabilities and services; •ability to integrate with other participants in the security and networking ecosystem; •price, total cost of ownership and network cost savings; •brand awareness, reputation and trust in the provider’s services; •strength of sales, marketing and channel partner relationships; and •quality of customer support. We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. Our cloud platform integrates many of the point products offered by our competitors and potential competitors, which is a key differentiator. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more diverse product and services offerings and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our services, including through selling at zero or negative margins, offering concessions, 10Table of Contentsproduct bundling or maintaining closed technology platforms. Further, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their appliance-based network security architecture, and may not be willing or ready to abandon those historical investments. As our market grows and rapidly changes, we expect it will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new products and services. In addition, we may expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets. Intellectual Property Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2019, we had over 130 total issued and pending patents, including in excess of 80 issued patents, in the United States and other countries. Our issued patents expire between 2028 and 2036 and cover various aspects of our cloud platform. In addition, we have registered “Zscaler” as a trademark in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we have registered other trademarks and filed other trademark applications in the United States. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Zscaler” and similar variations. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our subscription and license agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition to our internally developed technology, we also license software, including open source software, from third parties that we integrate into or bundle with our cloud platform. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies and non-practicing entities, have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or channel partners, with whom our license or other agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from offering certain services or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected subscriptions or services, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors-Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, or other lawsuits asserted against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects” for additional information. Employees We had approximately 1,480 employees worldwide as of July 31, 2019. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We may be required to comply with the terms of these collective bargaining agreements. 11Table of ContentsCorporate InformationWe were incorporated in the state of Delaware in September 2007 as SafeChannel, Inc., and in August 2008, we changed our name to Zscaler, Inc.

2020-09-17T20:23:12Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1713683,"Item 1. BusinessOverviewOur mission is to make the cloud safe for business and enjoyable for users. We deliver four integrated and comprehensive solutions to our customers using our cloud platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange:•Secure access to the internet and SaaS with Zscaler Internet Access or ZIA;•Secure access to internal applications with Zscaler Private Access or ZPA;•Management and enhancement of the user-to-application experience with Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX; and•Workload SegmentationWe were incorporated in 2007, during the early stages of cloud adoption and mobility, based on a vision that the internet would become the new corporate network as the cloud becomes the new data center. We predicted that with rapid cloud adoption and increasing workforce mobility, traditional perimeter security approaches would provide inadequate protection for users and data and an increasingly poor user experience. We pioneered a cloud platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, that represents a fundamental shift in the architectural design and approach to networking and security. Enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud to achieve greater IT agility, a faster pace of innovation and lower costs. Organizations are increasingly relying on internet destinations for a range of business activities, adopting new external SaaS applications for critical business functions and moving their internally managed applications to the public cloud, IaaS or PaaS. Enterprise users now expect to be able to seamlessly access applications and data, wherever they are hosted, from any device, anywhere in the world. We believe these trends are indicative of the broader digital transformation agenda, as businesses increasingly succeed or fail based on their IT outcomes. We believe that securing the on-premises corporate network to protect users and data is becoming increasingly irrelevant in a cloud and mobile-first world where organizations depend on the internet, a network they do not control and cannot secure, to access critical applications that power their businesses. We pioneered a new approach that securely connects users, devices, and applications using business policies, regardless of the network. Our Zero Trust Exchange eliminates the need for traditional on-premises security appliances that are difficult to maintain and require compromises between security, cost and user experience. This purpose-built, multi-tenant, distributed cloud platform incorporates the security functionality needed to enable users, applications, and devices to safely and efficiently utilize authorized applications and services based on an organization’s business policies. Before our Zero Trust Exchange, the corporate data center served as the central hub of IT security, with a physical network perimeter used to separate corporate users, devices and applications from the internet. Today, the network perimeter consists of appliances that have become fundamentally less effective as applications, data, users and devices rapidly move off the corporate network, making the notion of a corporate perimeter obsolete. In a world where more companies are shifting their most critical IT assets to the cloud, a zero trust architecture is required. Our architecture is vastly different from the traditional “hub-and-spoke” corporate network, where traffic from branch offices is routed to centralized data centers for security scanning and policy enforcement before reaching its destination. In contrast, our Zero Trust Exchange, which is distributed across 150 data centers worldwide, acts as an intelligent switchboard that uses business policies to securely connect users, devices, and applications over any network. We provide all of these solutions at scale, processing well over 100 billion internet requests per day. Our Zero Trust Exchange eliminates the need for organizations to buy and manage a 3Table of Contentsvariety of high cost appliances that need to be maintained by a large number of highly skilled security personnel, who are expensive and in increasingly short supply. Our cloud native, multitenant architecture, which Gartner refers to as SASE, is distributed across 150 data centers globally to bring security and business policy close to users and devices in 185 countries to provide fast, secure, and reliable access. Each day, we block over 100 million threats and perform over 175,000 unique security updates. Our customers benefit from the cloud effect of our ever-expanding ecosystem because once a new threat is detected, it can be blocked across our entire customer base within minutes. Many of the largest enterprises and government agencies in the world rely on our solutions to help them accelerate their move to the cloud. We have over 4,500 customers across all major geographies, with an emphasis on larger organizations, and we currently count over 450 of the Forbes Global 2000 as customers. Our customers span every major industry, including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services. We have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing from $190.2 million in fiscal 2018 to $302.8 million in fiscal 2019 to $431.3 million in fiscal 2020, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 59% and 42%, respectively. We experienced net losses of $115.1 million, $28.7 million and $33.6 million in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.Our Solutions and Zero Trust Exchange Platform Our Zero Trust Exchange cloud security platform delivers four comprehensive and integrated solutions built natively in the cloud to power digital transformation.Secure Internet and SaaS Access - Zscaler Internet Access Zscaler Internet Access, or ZIA, was designed to provide users, servers, operational technology, or OT, and internet of things, or IoT, device secure access to externally managed applications, including SaaS applications and internet destinations regardless of device, location or network. ZIA provides inline content inspection and firewall access controls across all ports and protocols to protect organizations and users from external threats as well as protecting an organization’s data while at rest and preventing data from leaking out. Policies follow the user to provide identical protection on any device, regardless of location; any policy changes are enforced for users worldwide. Our cloud security platform provides full inline content inspection to assess and correlate the risk of the content to protect against sophisticated, including ransomware and phishing. The cloud platform applies machine learning across our well over 100 billion daily transactions to identify and block unknown threats quickly.  ZIA enables four primary use cases: Cyberthreat Protection – Our threat prevention functionality enables protection against threats using a range of approaches and techniques. Our threat prevention capabilities provide multiple layers of protection to prevent sophisticated ransomware, phishing, and zero-day cyberattacks. We provide functionality that traditionally has been offered by disparate, stand-alone products. Core cloud platform threat prevention services include:  •Advanced Threat Protection: Our advanced protection functionality delivers real-time protection from malicious internet content like browser exploits, scripts, zero-pixel iFrames, malware and botnet callbacks. Over 175,000 unique security updates are performed every day to the Zscaler cloud to keep users protected. Once we detect a new threat to a user, we block it for all users. We call this the “cloud security effect.” 4Table of Contents•Cloud Sandbox: Our cloud sandbox enables enterprises to block zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats, or APTs, by analyzing unknown files for malicious behavior, and it can scale to every user regardless of location. Our cloud sandbox was designed and built to be multi-tenant and allows customers to determine which traffic should be sent for inspection. As an integrated cloud security platform, customers can set policies by users and destinations to prevent patient-zero scenarios by holding, detonating and analyzing suspicious files in the sandbox before being sent to the user. •Browser Isolation: Our cloud browser isolation functionality creates an isolated browsing session that enables users to access any webpage on the internet without downloading any of the web content served by the webpage onto a local device or the corporate network. With Zscaler Cloud Browser Isolation, users are not directly accessing active web content; instead, only a safe rendering of pixels is delivered to the user. Malicious code that may be hidden in the web content is kept at bay.  Data Protection- Our data protection functionality enables enterprises to prevent unauthorized sharing or exfiltration of confidential information for users, devices, and servers, reducing our customers’ business and compliance risk. Core cloud platform data protection services include:•Data Loss Prevention: Our data loss prevention enables enterprises to use predefined or custom dictionaries using efficient pattern-matching algorithms to easily scale to all users and traffic, including compressed or encrypted traffic, to prevent, monitor or block unauthorized or sensitive data exfiltration. Our exact data match, or EDM, functionality augments the accuracy and efficacy of our data loss prevention solution by enabling our customers to populate a custom database scaling to billions of unique fields. Our data loss prevention policies can be enforced for inline data in motion and out-of-band for data at rest. •Cloud Application Security Brokerage: Our Cloud Access Security Broker, or CASB, and cloud application controls enable enterprises to discover and granularly control user access to known and unknown cloud applications. By doing Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, interception at scale, we provide malware protection, data loss prevention and CASB functions that can be performed both inline and out-of-band, for specific sanctioned applications. Business policies can be defined with granular access control for specified cloud applications, such as the ability to upload or download files or post comments or videos based on different user or group identity. •File Type Controls: Our file type control allows policies to be defined that control which file types are allowed to be downloaded and uploaded based on application, user, location and destination. •Browser Isolation: With Zscaler Cloud Browser Isolation, users are not directly accessing active web content; instead, only a safe rendering of pixels is delivered to the user.  This approach prevents sensitive data from being downloaded to unauthorized devices in bring your own device environments or on shared public computers.Secure Local Internet Breakouts – Our local internet breakout capability means traffic destined for the cloud no longer needs to be routed over a private Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MPLS, network to the data center. Traffic can now be routed locally over the internet and directly to the cloud, which provides for a faster experience and a significant reduction in MPLS network costs. Our core cloud platform services for local internet breakouts include: •Cloud Firewall: Our cloud firewall was designed to protect users by inspecting internet traffic on all ports and protocols, and it offers user level policies, application identification with deep packet inspection and intrusion prevention. •Bandwidth Control: Our bandwidth control and traffic shaping capabilities ensure that business critical applications are prioritized over non-business critical applications, improving productivity and user experience. By 5Table of Contentsenforcing quality of service in the cloud, our platform enables the optimization of “last-mile” utilization of a customer’s network, providing significant value. •DNS: Our Domain Name System, or DNS, filtering solution provides a local DNS resolver and enforces acceptable use policies. Secure Device and Workload Internet Communication - The massive growth in connected devices and machine to machine communications opens up new attack vectors for cybercriminals. Zscaler Internet Access provides inline cyberthreat and data protection to workload, server, IoT, and OT to internet communications to enable the reduction in business risk.  Secure Private Application Access - Zscaler Private AccessZscaler Private Access, or ZPA, was designed to provide secure access to internally managed applications, either hosted internally in data centers or hosted in private or public clouds. ZPA was designed around four key tenets that fundamentally change the way users access internal applications: •connect users to applications without bringing users on the network; •never expose applications to the internet; •segment access to applications without relying on traditional approach of network segmentation; and •provide remote access over the internet without virtual private networks, or VPNs.ZPA enforces a global policy engine that manages access to internally managed applications regardless of location. If access is granted to a user, our ZPA solution connects the user’s device only to the authorized application without exposing the identity or location of the application. Hence applications are not exposed to the internet, further limiting the external attack surface. This results in reduced cost and complexity, while offering better security and an improved user experience. Our ZPA solution includes broad functionality, which we categorize by the following areas: •Secure Application Access: Our ZPA solution delivers seamless connectivity to internally managed applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, enterprise data center, or both. Administrators can set global policies from a single console, enabling policy-driven access that is agnostic to the network the users are on. By creating seamless access to applications regardless of a user’s network, our ZPA solution eliminates the need for traditional remote access VPNs, SSL, reverse proxies and other similar products. •Application Discovery: Similar to CASB application discovery reports for internet applications, our ZPA solution provides granular discovery of internally managed applications to aid in the creation of segmentation policies. Because our ZPA solution sits on the application layer and is name-based or domain-based, organizations can quickly and seamlessly identify the internally-managed applications that are running on the network and then easily provision appropriate policies. •Application Segmentation: This architecture provides capabilities that enable user and application level segmentation, a vast improvement over traditional network segmentation. As each user-to-application connection is segmented with microtunnels, each of which is a temporary session between a specific user and a specific application, lateral movement across the network is prevented, significantly reducing security risk. Microtunnels eliminate the need for internal firewalls, which are required for protecting against lateral malware propagation from machine to machine, and traditional network access control functionality since users are granted access only to applications for which they have permission and are not granted full access to the network. 6Table of Contents•Application Protection: Our ZPA solution initiates and connects outbound-only links between authenticated users and internally managed applications using microtunnels. Access is provided to users without bringing them onto the corporate network and without exposing applications to the internet. Internally managed applications are not discoverable or identifiable. With no inbound connections and no public IP addresses, there is no inbound attack surface and therefore no threat of distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks. With our innovative approach, we eliminate the need for a next-generation firewall. Similarly, by completely removing the need for an exposed IP address or DNS to the internet, we eliminate the need for DDoS mitigation systems. The primary use cases for our ZPA solution include: •remote workforce access to private applications without legacy VPN - zero trust from office to data center; •providing non-employees with secure access to internal applications; •securely connecting business-to-business, or B2B, customers, service providers and supplier access to applications typically deployed as business to business portals in an extranet; •direct-to-cloud access to internally managed applications hosted in public cloud environments, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform; and •access to applications following a merger or acquisition by providing named users with access to named applications, without the need to merge networks. Experience Management - Zscaler Digital ExperienceZscaler Digital Experience, or ZDX, is designed to measure end-to-end user experience across key business applications, providing an easy to understand digital experience score for each user, application and location within an enterprise. As users have become mobile and applications have moved to the cloud, traditional network performance monitoring tools have become increasingly irrelevant. Enterprises can no longer collect performance metrics or indicators along the traditional network path as they could when they owned the network and the applications ran in their own data centers. When a user's experience is suffering or an event is negatively impacting user experience, ZDX allows an organization to isolate where in the network path an issue is occurring and whether it is caused by a user’s device, the WiFi connection, the local internet connection, a service provider in the path or the destination application itself. With ZDX, enterprises can quickly determine if an issue is associated with a single user, application or location or indicates a broader issue potentially impacting other users, applications or locations all via a simple visual workflow without a need for additional hardware or software.Workload SegmentationWe secure applications and workloads by automatically identifying and remediating cloud misconfigurations and by segmenting workloads to prevent the lateral movement of malware and ransomware across a network, without having to do legacy network segmentation.•Zscaler Cloud Security Posture Management: Zscaler Cloud Security Posture Management, or CSPM, automatically identifies and remediates application misconfigurations in SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS to reduce risk and ensure compliance with industry and organizational benchmarks. Our CSPM solution connects to SaaS, IaaS and PaaS such as O365, AWS and Azure via application APIs and continuously monitors these environments to detect and prevent cloud misconfigurations. CSPM provides visibility into risk posture, enforces set standards via remediation guidance and auto-remediation, enables governance of security policies and compliance frameworks via exceptions and private benchmark compliance dashboards. In addition, reporting is available for multiple regulatory 7Table of Contentsschemes, including CIS, CSA, NIST, ISO, FFIEC, RBI, PCI, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, UK NCSC and GxP Life sciences.•Zscaler Cloud Workload Segmentation: Zscaler Cloud Workload Segmentation, or CWS, secures application-to-application communications inside public clouds and data centers to stop lateral threat movement, preventing application compromise and reducing the risk of data breaches. Our CWS product utilizes an innovative approach that makes it significantly simpler to deploy and operate than traditional segmentation solutions. CWS considerably improves the security of east-west communication by verifying the identity of the communicating application software, services and processes to achieve a zero trust environment. This reduces the attack surface which lowers the risk of application compromise and data breaches. Our solution discovers individual applications and their legitimate communication patterns and, using machine learning algorithms, automatically creates and enforces authorized communications to provide application segmentation. Use cases include microsegmentation, multi-cloud workload protection, enabling secure public cloud migration, and zero trust security initiatives. CWS greatly reduces operational complexity while enhancing security through zero trust identity policies that are simpler than traditional address-based rules, automating policy management without requiring network changes to implement microsegmentation.Our Technology and Architecture We are driven by technology and innovation. We developed a highly scalable, multi-tenant, globally distributed cloud capable of providing inline inspection of internet and SasS traffic, securing access to private applications, protecting cloud applications and managing digital experience. We designed and developed a purpose-built three-tier architecture starting with our core operating system and adding layers of security and networking innovations over time. Our cloud platform is protected by more than 190 issued and pending patents. Our cloud is distributed across more than 150 data centers on five continents and processes approximately well over 120 billion requests per day from users across 185 countries. The platform is designed to be resilient, redundant and high-performing. Our platform is built as software modules that run on standard x86 platforms without any dependency on custom hardware. The platform modules are split into the control plane (Zscaler Central Authority), the enforcement plane (Zscaler Enforcement Nodes) and the logging and statistics plane (Zscaler Nanolog Servers) as described below:•Zscaler Central Authority: The Zscaler Central Authority monitors our entire security cloud and provides a central location for software and database updates, policy and configuration settings and threat intelligence. The collection of Zscaler Central Authority instances together act like the brain of the cloud, and they are geographically distributed for redundancy and performance. •Zscaler Enforcement Nodes: Customer traffic is directed to the nearest Zscaler Enforcement Node, where security, management and compliance policies served by the Zscaler Central Authority are enforced. The Zscaler Enforcement Node also incorporates our differentiated authentication and policy distribution mechanism that enables any user to connect to any Zscaler Enforcement Node at any time to ensure full policy enforcement. The Zscaler Enforcement Node utilizes a full proxy architecture and is built to ensure data is not written to disk to maintain the highest level of data security. Data is scanned in RAM only and then erased. Logs are continuously created in memory and forwarded to our logging module. •Zscaler Log Servers: Our nanolog technology is built into the Zscaler Enforcement Node to perform lossless compression of logs, enabling our platform to collect over 100 terabytes of unique raw log data every day. We do not collect customer data other than logs, and those logs are encrypted, never written to disk at enforcement nodes, and stored at destination of choice. Logs are transmitted to our logging servers over secure connections and multicast to multiple servers for redundancy. Our dashboards provide our customers visibility into their traffic to 8Table of Contentsenable troubleshooting, policy changes and other administrative actions. Our analytics capabilities allow customers to interactively mine billions of transaction logs to generate reports that provide insight on network utilization and traffic. We do not rely on batch reporting; we continuously update our dashboards and reporting and can stream logs to a third-party Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM, service as they arrive. Regardless of where users are located, customers can choose to have logs stored in the United States or the European Union/Switzerland. Customer data is isolated as part of our multi-tenant architecture. Our platform is a critical integration point positioned in the data path providing secure access to the internet, cloud and internal applications. We complement and interoperate with key technology and cloud vendors across major market segments, including software-defined wide area network, or SD-WAN, identity and access management, or IAM, device and endpoint management, as well as SIEM for reporting and analytics. Many of these vendors, like us, were developed in the cloud and together provide a foundation for a modern access and security architecture. Growth Strategies The growing use of the internet and the increasing adoption of the cloud and mobility are driving network and application transformation. As a provider of a fully integrated, multi-tenant cloud security solution, we enable our customers to accelerate this secure transformation to the cloud and believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize value as they undertake these transitions. Key elements of our growth strategy include: •Continue to win new customers. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand our customer base, both in the United States and internationally. We have invested significantly in our sales and marketing organization to execute against this opportunity. •Expand in existing customers. We leverage a land-and-expand approach with our existing customers to sell subscriptions for additional users, additional a la carte solutions and premium solution bundles that contain more functionality.•Leverage channel partners to participate in cloud transformation initiatives. We have invested in establishing long-standing relationships with global telecommunications service providers and are expanding our network of global system integrators and regional telecommunications service providers and cloud-centric value-added resellers.•Expansion and innovation of services. We continue to invest in research and development and acquire new technologies and products in order to add new and differentiated solutions to our existing product portfolio and to improve the overall functionality, reliability, availability and scalability of our cloud security platform. •Expansion into additional market segments. We are primarily targeting the expansion of our immediate addressable market, emphasizing U.S. federal government agencies in the near- to medium-term as well as additional international markets in the Asia Pacific region.We sell to enterprises of all sizes. As of July 31, 2020, we had over 4,500 customers, including over 450 of the Forbes Global 2000. Many of our customers include major global enterprises that send virtually all of their internet traffic through our cloud security platform. Our customers operate in a variety of industries, including airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services. Approximately 51% of our revenue in each of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 and 55% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 was from customers outside the United States. No end customer contributed more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018.9Table of ContentsSales and MarketingAlthough we have a channel sales model, we use a joint sales approach in which our sales force develops relationships directly with our customers, and together with our channel account teams, works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. Our customer care and success teams maintain high-touch relationships with our customers to deploy and manage our cloud platform, identify, analyze and resolve performance issues and respond to security threats. We believe customer service touchpoints are opportunities to further develop our relationship with our customers and potentially generate incremental revenue through the addition of new users and services. Our channel partners consist of global telecommunications service provider, system integrator and value-added reseller partners, and we leverage their relationships to expand our reach, improve procurement and accelerate customer fulfillment. We enter into agreements with our channel partners in the ordinary course of business. The contracts typically have a one-year term and renew automatically, subject to cancellation by either party upon 90 days’ notice. These agreements contain standard commercial terms and conditions, including payment terms, billing frequency, warranties and indemnification. Our channel partners generally place purchase orders with us after receiving orders from customers. We generally maintain privity of contract with customers through end user subscription agreements. We expect to continue investing in our channel partners as we provide them with education, training and programs, including supporting their independent sales of our solutions. We believe that such investment, and investments in our sales force, will lead to significant expansion in our customer base, which will materially impact our business and results of operations. Our marketing strategy is focused on platform and brand awareness, which drives our opportunity pipeline and customer demand. This strategy is account-based, enabling us to pursue targeted marketing activities across both digital and non-digital channels. We anticipate increasing our marketing team headcount and are investing in programs designed to elevate our brand in the market and engage new enterprise accounts. We also participate in a number of cloud and security industry events. In addition, we have a deeply integrated ecosystem of channel partners, with whom we engage in joint marketing activities. Data Center Operations We operate our services across more than 150 data centers around the world, which are built to be highly resilient, have multiple levels of redundancy and provide failover to other data centers in our network. Our data centers are co-located within top-tier internet interconnection hubs that have direct connectivity, known as peering, to major telecommunication service providers, SaaS providers, public cloud providers, internet content providers and popular internet destinations. A number of our data centers are also located with our service provider partners. Our platform has received ISO 27001 certification since 2014. In addition, we received ISO 27701 and 270018 certifications in 2020. We are also SOC2 compliant and cleared at the FedRamp High level for ZPA and “In Process” status at the High Impact level for ZIA.Research and Development Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, operation and quality of our cloud platform. In addition to improving on our features, functionality and scalability, this organization works closely with our cloud operations team to ensure that our platform is reliable, available and scalable. ThreatLabZ, our internal team of security experts, researchers and network engineers, analyzes the global threat landscape, works to eliminate threats across our cloud platform and reports on emerging security issues. 10Table of ContentsResearch and development expense was $97.9 million, $62.0 million and $39.4 million for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. Our research and development leadership team is based in San Jose, California, and we also maintain research and development centers in India, Canada and Spain. Competition The market for security solutions is defined by changing technologies, an evolving threat landscape and complex enterprise needs. Our competitors and potential competitors include legacy on-premises appliance vendors across a number of categories: •independent IT security vendors, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., Fortinet, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and Broadcom, which offer a broad mix of network and endpoint security products; •large networking vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. and Juniper Networks, Inc., which offer security appliances and incorporate security capabilities in their networking products; •companies such as FireEye, Inc., Forcepoint Inc. (previously, Websense, Inc.) and Pulse Secure, LLC with point solutions that compete with some of the features of our cloud platform, such as proxy, firewall, sandboxing and advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, encryption, load balancing and VPN; and •other providers of IT security services that offer, or may leverage related technologies to introduce, products that compete with or are alternatives to our cloud platform. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include: •delivering security from the cloud regardless of location of the user; •platform features, effectiveness and extensibility; •platform reliability, availability and scalability; •rapid development and delivery of new capabilities and services; •ability to integrate with other participants in the security and networking ecosystem; •price, total cost of ownership and network cost savings; •brand awareness, reputation and trust in the provider’s services; •strength of sales, marketing and channel partner relationships; and •quality of customer support. We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. Our cloud platform integrates many of the point products offered by our competitors and potential competitors, which is a key differentiator. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more diverse product and services offerings and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our services, including through selling at zero or negative margins, offering concessions, product bundling or maintaining closed technology platforms. Further, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their appliance-based network security architecture and may not be willing or ready to abandon those historical investments. As our market grows and rapidly changes, we expect it will continue 11Table of Contentsto attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new products and services. In addition, we may expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets. Intellectual Property Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2020, we had over 190 issued and pending patents, including in excess of 110 issued patents, in the United States and other countries. Our issued patents expire between 2028 and 2039 and cover various aspects of our cloud platform. In addition, we have registered “Zscaler” as a trademark in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we have registered other trademarks and filed other trademark applications in the United States. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Zscaler” and similar variations. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our subscription and license agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition to our internally developed technology, we also license software, including open source software, from third parties that we integrate into or bundle with our cloud platform. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies and non-practicing entities, have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or channel partners, with whom our license or other agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from offering certain services or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected subscriptions or services, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors-Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, or other lawsuits asserted against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects” for additional information. Employees We had approximately 2,020 employees worldwide as of July 31, 2020. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We may be required to comply with the terms of these collective bargaining agreements.12Table of ContentsCorporate InformationWe were incorporated in the state of Delaware in September 2007 as SafeChannel, Inc., and in August 2008, we changed our name to Zscaler, Inc.

With products and services ranging from aircraft engines, power generation, water processing, and household appliances to medical imaging, business and consumerfinancing and industrial products, we serve customers in more than 100 countries and employ approximately 287,000 people worldwide. Prior to January 28, 2011, we also operated a media company, NBC Universal, Inc. (NBCU). EffectiveJanuary 28, 2011, we hold a 49% interest in a media entity that includes the NBC Universal businesses. See the NBC Universal section of this Item for additional information. Since our incorporation in 1892, we have developed or acquired newtechnologies and services that have broadened and changed considerably the scope of our activities.  In virtually all of our global business activities,we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we believe that, ingeneral, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in which we participate. The NBC Television Network, which became part of the media entity referred to above as of January 28, 2011, is a major U.S. commercial broadcasttelevision network. NBC Universal also competes with other film and television programming producers and distributors, cable/satellite television networks and theme park operators. The businesses in which GECS engages are subject to competition fromvarious types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks, broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer loan companies, independent finance companies and finance companies associated withmanufacturers.   (3) Table of ContentsThis document contains “forward-looking statements” – that is, statements related to future, not past,events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,”“plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see” or “will.” Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties that could cause ouractual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include: current economic and financial conditions, including volatility in interest and exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value offinancial assets; the impact of conditions in the financial and credit markets on the availability and cost of General Electric Capital Corporation’s (GECC) funding and on our ability to reduce GECC’s asset levels as planned; the impact ofconditions in the housing market and unemployment rates on the level of commercial and consumer credit defaults; changes in Japanese consumer behavior that may affect our estimates of liability for excess interest refund claims (Grey Zone); ourability to maintain our current credit rating and the impact on our funding costs and competitive position if we do not do so; the adequacy of our cash flow and earnings and other conditions which may affect our ability to pay our quarterly dividendat the planned level; the level of demand and financial performance of the major industries we serve, including, without limitation, air and rail transportation, energy generation, network television, real estate and healthcare; the impact ofregulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of financial services regulation; strategic actions, including acquisitions and dispositions and our success in integrating acquiredbusinesses; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business and competitive nature. These uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than thoseexpressed in our forward-looking statements. These uncertainties are described in more detail in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K Report. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements. Operating Segments  Segment revenue and profit informationand additional financial data and commentary on recent financial results for operating segments are provided in the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations” and in Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.  Operating businesses that are reported as segments include Energy Infrastructure, Technology Infrastructure, NBC Universal, GE Capital and Home & Business Solutions. Net earnings of GECS and the effect oftransactions between segments are eliminated to arrive at total consolidated data. A summary description of each of our operating segments follows. Effective January 1, 2011, we reorganized the Technology Infrastructure segment into three segments – Aviation, Healthcare and Transportation. Theresults of the Aviation, Healthcare and Transportation businesses are unaffected by this reorganization and we will begin reporting these as separate segments beginning with our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011.Results for 2010 and prior periods in this Form 10-K Report are reported on the basis under which we managed our businesses in 2010 and do not reflect the January 2011 reorganization.  We also continue our longstanding practice of providing supplemental information for certain businesses within the segments.  Energy Infrastructure  Energy Infrastructure (25.0%, 26.2% and 23.7% of consolidated revenues in 2010, 2009 and2008, respectively) is a leader in the field of development, implementation and improvement of products and technologies that harness resources such as wind, oil, gas and water.

Energy also provides protectionand control, communications, power sensing and power quality products and services that increase the reliability of electrical power networks and critical equipment and offering wireless data transmission. Energy is party to revenue sharing programs that share the financial results of certain aero-derivative lines. These businesses are controlled by Energy, butcounterparties have an agreed share of revenues as well as development and component production responsibilities. At December 31, 2010, such counterparty interests ranged from 5% to 49% of various programs; associated distributions to suchcounterparties are accounted for as costs of production.  Worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. Demand for powergeneration is global and, as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business. The balance of regional growth and demand side management are important factors to evaluate as we plan for futuredevelopment.  Oil & Gas  Our technologyhelps oil and gas companies make more efficient and sustainable use of the world’s energy resources.   (5) Table of ContentsOil & Gas supplies mission critical equipment for the global oil and gas industry, used in applicationsspanning the entire value chain from drilling and completion through production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline compression, pipeline inspection, and including downstream processing in refineries and petrochemical plants. The businessdesigns and manufactures surface and subsea drilling and production systems, equipment for floating production platforms, compressors, turbines, turboexpanders, high pressure reactors, industrial power generation and a broad portfolio of auxiliaryequipment.

The business also provides upgrades to customers’ machines, using the latest available technology, to extend production capability and environmental performance. For information about orders and backlog, see the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.  Technology Infrastructure Technology Infrastructure (25.2%, 24.8% and 22.9% of consolidated revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively) is one of the world’s leading providers ofessential technologies to developed, developing and emerging countries. Around the world, we are helping build healthcare, transportation and technology infrastructure.  Our operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.  Aviation Aviation produces, sells and services jet engines, turboprop and turbo shaft engines, and related replacement parts for use in military and commercial aircraft. Ourmilitary engines are used in a wide variety of aircraft including fighters, bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as marine applications, and our commercial engines power aircraft in all categories of range: short/medium,intermediate and long-range, as well as executive and regional aircraft. We also produce and market engines through CFM International, a company jointly owned by GE and Snecma, a subsidiary of SAFRAN of France, and Engine Alliance, LLC, a companyjointly owned by GE and the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation. New engines are also being designed and marketed in joint ventures with Rolls-Royce Group plc and Honda Aero, Inc., a division of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. Aviation is party to agreements in which the financial results, as well as production responsibilities, of certain aircraft and marine engine lines areshared. These agreements take the form of both joint ventures and revenue sharing programs.  Joint ventures market and sell particular aircraft enginelines, but require negligible direct investment because the venture parties conduct essentially all of the development, production, assembly and aftermarket support activities. Under these agreements, Aviation supplies certain engine components andretains related intellectual property rights. The CFM56 engine line is the product of CFM International and the GP7000 engine line is the product of Engine Alliance, LLC.  Revenue sharing programs are a standard form of cooperation for specific product programs in the aviation industry. These businesses are controlled by Aviation, but counterparties have an agreed share of revenuesas well as development and component production responsibilities. At December 31, 2010, such counterparty interests ranged from 2% to 49% of various programs; associated distributions to such counterparties are accounted for as costs ofproduction.   (6) Table of ContentsAviation also produces global aerospace systems and equipment, including airborne platform computing systems, powergeneration and distribution products, mechanical actuation products and landing gear, plus various engine components for use in both military and commercial aircraft.  We provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (MRO), including sales of replacement parts for many models of engines and repair and overhaul of engines manufactured by competitors. These MROservices are often provided under long-term maintenance contracts.  The worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and MRO (including parts sales) isintense. Both U.S. and export markets are important. Product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused intellectualproperty strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. Our products and services are subject to a number of regulatory standards. Potential sales for any engine are limited by, among other things, its technological lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance intechnology, the small number of potential customers and the limited number of relevant airframe applications. Aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and airline procurement cycles, although these cycles differ from each other. Healthcare  Healthcare has expertise in medical imaging andinformation technologies, medical diagnostics, patient monitoring systems, disease research, drug discovery and biopharmaceutical manufacturing technologies. We are dedicated to predicting and detecting disease earlier, monitoring its progress andinforming physicians, and helping physicians tailor treatment for patients.

NBCU has exclusive U.S. television rights to the2012 Olympic Games, National Football League Sunday Night Football and the Super Bowl in 2012.   (8) Table of ContentsNBCU is subject to a wide range of factors, which could adversely affect our operations. The broadcast networks, cabletelevision networks and television stations are in extremely competitive and dynamic markets and are subject to advertising patterns and changes in viewer taste and preference that can be unpredictable or unforeseen. In addition, future revenues inthese properties are dependent upon NBCU’s ability to obtain, renew or renegotiate long-term programming contracts, including event-based sports programming and contracts for the distribution of programming to cable/satellite operators.NBCU’s television and film production and distribution businesses are affected by the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Technological advances like digital video recorders, Internetstreaming and electronic sell-through offer entertainment options through new media, introducing uncertainty to NBCU’s operations. Other technologies enable the unauthorized copying and distribution of our film and television programming,increasing the risk of piracy. NBCU continues to devote substantial resources to protect its intellectual property against unauthorized use.  Prior toSeptember 2010, we owned 80% of NBCU and Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi) owned 20%. In September 2010, we acquired approximately 38% of Vivendi’s 20% ownership interest in NBCU (7.7% of NBCU’s outstanding shares). Prior to and in connection withthe transaction with Comcast Corporation (Comcast), we acquired the remaining Vivendi interest in NBCU (12.3% of NBCU’s outstanding shares). On January 28, 2011, we transferred the assets of the NBCU business and Comcast transferredcertain of its assets comprising cable networks, regional sports networks, certain digital properties and certain unconsolidated investments to a newly formed entity, NBC Universal LLC (NBCU LLC). In connection with the transaction, we received cashof $6.2 billion from Comcast and a 49% interest in NBCU LLC. Comcast holds the remaining 51% interest in NBCU LLC. We will account for our investment in NBCU LLC under the equity method.  NBC Universal’s headquarters are in New York, New York, with operations throughout North America, Europe, South America and Asia.

Our operations are located in North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.  GE Capital has communicatedits goal of reducing its ending net investment (ENI). To achieve this goal, we are more aggressively focusing our businesses on selective financial services products where we have domain knowledge, broad distribution, and the ability to earn aconsistent return on capital, while managing our overall balance sheet size and risk. We have a strategy of exiting those businesses where we are underperforming or that are deemed to be non-strategic. We have completed a number of dispositions inour businesses in the past and will continue to evaluate options going forward.   (9) Table of ContentsCommercial Lending and Leasing  CLL provides customers around the world with a broad range of financing solutions. We have particular mid-market expertise, and primarily offer collateralized loans, leases and other financial services tocustomers, including manufacturers, distributors and end-users for a variety of equipment and major capital assets. These assets include industrial-related facilities and equipment; vehicles; corporate aircraft; and equipment used in manyindustries, including the construction, manufacturing, transportation, media, communications, entertainment and healthcare industries. During 2009, we acquired a 100% ownership interest in Interbanca S.p.A., an Italian corporate bank in exchange forthe Consumer businesses in Austria and Finland, our credit card and auto businesses in the U.K. and our credit card business in Ireland.  Historically,we have operated in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include commercial banks, investment banks, leasing companies, financing companies associated with manufacturers, and independent finance companies. Competition related to ourlending and leasing operations is based on price, that is, interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. More recently, competition has been affected by disruption in the capital markets, access to and availability of capital and areduced number of competitors. Profitability is affected not only by broad economic conditions that affect customer credit quality and the availability and cost of capital funding, but also by successful management of credit risk, operating risk andmarket risks such as interest rate and currency exchange risks. Success requires high quality risk management systems, customer and industry specific knowledge, diversification, service and distribution channels, strong collateral and assetmanagement knowledge, deal structuring expertise and the ability to reduce costs through technology and productivity.  In the first quarter of 2009, wedeconsolidated Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. (PTL) following our sale of a partial interest in a limited partnership in PTL.

BAC has been classified as a discontinued operation.  In October 2010, we purchased sales finance portfolios from Citi RetailPartner Cards, which provides consumer financing programs and related services to small to mid-sized retailers and dealers.   (10) Table of ContentsOur operations are subject to a variety of bank and consumer protection regulations. Further, a number of countrieshave ceilings on rates chargeable to consumers in financial service transactions. We are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions including commercial banks, leasing companies, consumer loan companies, independent financecompanies, finance companies associated with manufacturers, and insurance companies. Industry participants compete on the basis of price, servicing capability, promotional marketing, risk management, and cross selling. The markets in which weoperate are also subject to the risks from fluctuations in retail sales, interest and currency exchange rates, and the consumer’s capacity to repay debt.  Real Estate  Real Estate offers a comprehensive range of capital and investment solutions, including equitycapital for acquisition or development, as well as fixed and floating rate mortgages for new acquisitions or re-capitalizations of commercial real estate worldwide.

We invest in, and provide restructuring financing for, portfolios of commercial mortgage loans, limited partnerships and tax-exempt bonds.  We own and operate a global portfolio of real estate with the objective of maximizing property cash flows and asset values. In the normal course of our business operations, we sell certain real estate equityinvestments when it is economically advantageous for us to do so. However, as real estate values are affected by certain forces beyond our control (e.g., market fundamentals and demographic conditions), it is difficult to predict with certainty thelevel of future sales, sales prices, impairments or write-offs.  Our competitors include banks, financial institutions, real estate companies, realestate investment funds and other financial companies. Competition in our equity investment business is primarily based on price, and competition in our lending business is primarily based on interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure andterms. As we compete globally, our success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business.  EnergyFinancial Services  Energy Financial Services offers structured equity, debt, leasing, partnership financing, project finance and broad-basedcommercial finance to the global energy and water industries and invests in operating assets in these industries.

This resulted in the deconsolidation of Regency.  We operate in a highly competitive environment.Our competitors include banks, financial institutions, energy and water companies, and other finance and leasing companies. Competition is primarily based on price, that is, interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms.

For further information aboutdiscontinued operations, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “FinancialStatements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.   (12) Table of ContentsGeographic Data Geographic data is reported in Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” ofthis Form 10-K Report.  Additional financial data about our geographic operations is provided in the Geographic Operations section in Part II,Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.  OrdersBacklog  GE’s total backlog of firm unfilled orders at the end of 2010 was $66.7 billion, a decrease of 1% from year-end 2009, reflectingdecreased demand at Energy Infrastructure, partially offset by increased demand at Technology Infrastructure. Of this backlog, $46.0 billion related to products, of which 59% was scheduled for delivery in 2011. Product services orders, included inthis reported backlog for only the succeeding 12 months, were $20.6 billion at the end of 2010. Product services orders beyond the succeeding 12 months were approximately $108.7 billion, which combined with the firm unfilled orders described aboveresulted in a total backlog of approximately $175.4 billion at December 31, 2010. Orders constituting backlog may be cancelled or deferred by customers, subject in certain cases to penalties. See the Segment Operations section in Part II,Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report for further information.  Research and Development  GE-funded research and development expenditures were $3.9 billion, $3.3 billion and$3.1 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, research and development funding from customers, principally the U.S. government, totaled $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. TechnologyInfrastructure’s Aviation business accounts for the largest share of GE’s research and development expenditures with funding from both GE and customer funds. Energy Infrastructure’s Energy business and Technology Infrastructure’sHealthcare business also made significant expenditures funded primarily by GE.  Expenditures reported above reflect the definition of research anddevelopment required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. For operating and management purposes, we also measure amounts spent on product and services technology. These technology expenditures were $5.9 billion in 2010 and included ourreported research and development expenditures as well as the amount spent to improve our existing products and services, and to improve productivity of our plants, equipment and processes.  Environmental Matters  Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses,involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws. We are involved in a sizeable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Such statutes requirethat responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately $0.2 billion in 2010, $0.3 billion in 2009 and$0.2 billion in 2008. We presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about $0.4 billion for each of the next two years.   (13) Table of ContentsAs previously disclosed, in 2006, we entered into a consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) todredge PCB-containing sediment from the upper Hudson River. The consent decree provided that the dredging would be performed in two phases. Phase 1 was completed in May through November of 2009. Between Phase 1 and Phase 2 there was an interveningpeer review by an independent panel of national experts. The panel evaluated the performance of Phase 1 dredging operations with respect to Phase 1 Engineering Performance Standards and recommended proposed changes to the standards. OnDecember 17, 2010, EPA issued its decisions setting forth the final performance standards for Phase 2 of the dredging project, incorporating aspects of the recommendations from the independent peer review panel and from GE. In December 2010, weagreed with EPA to perform Phase 2 of the project in accordance with the final performance standards set by EPA. We have reviewed EPA’s final performance standards for Phase 2 to assess the potential scope and duration of Phase 2, as well asoperational and engineering changes that could be required. Based on this review and our best professional engineering judgment, we increased our reserve for the probable and estimable costs for completing the Hudson River dredging project by $0.8billion in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Employee Relations  At year-end 2010, General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates employed approximately 287,000 persons, of whom approximately 133,000 were employed in the United States. For further information aboutemployees, see Part II, Item 6. “Selected Financial Data” of this Form 10-K Report.  Approximately 15,200 GE manufacturing and serviceemployees in the United States are represented for collective bargaining purposes by a total of approximately 105 different union locals. A majority of such employees are represented by union locals that are affiliated with, and bargain incoordination with, the IUE-CWA, The Industrial Division of the Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO, CLC. During 2007, General Electric Company negotiated four-year contracts with unions representing a substantial majority of the unionizedemployees in the United States. Most of these contracts will terminate in June 2011, and we will be engaged in negotiations to attain new agreements. While results of 2011 union negotiations cannot be predicted, our recent past negotiations haveresulted in agreements that increased costs.  Approximately 3,500 staff employees (and a large number of freelance employees) in the United States arecovered by about 175 labor agreements to which NBC Universal is a party. These agreements are with various labor unions, expire at various dates and are generally for a term ranging from three to five years. Other GE affiliates are parties to laborcontracts with various labor unions, also with varying terms and expiration dates, that cover approximately 2,500 employees.  Executive Officers See Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” of this Form 10-K Report for information aboutExecutive Officers of the Registrant.  Other Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the widevariety of raw materials needed for our operations. We have not been adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials.  We own, or holdlicenses to use, numerous patents. New patents are continuously being obtained through our research and development activities as existing patents expire. Patented inventions are used both within the Company and are licensed to others, but nooperating segment is substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.   (14) Table of ContentsSales of goods and services to agencies of the U.S. Government as a percentage of revenues follow.     % of Consolidated Revenues  % of GE Revenues      2010         2009         2008         2010         2009         2008   Total sales to U.S. Government Agencies   4 %   4 %   3 %   5 %   6 %   4 %  Technology Infrastructure segment defense-related sales   3    3    2    4    4    3   GE is a trademark and service mark of General ElectricCompany.

Business General Unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms “GE,” “GECS” and “GECC” on the basis of consolidation described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report. Also, unless otherwise indicated by the context, “General Electric” means the parent company, General Electric Company (the Company).General Electric’s address is 1 River Road, Schenectady, NY 12345-6999; we also maintain executive offices at 3135 Easton Turnpike, Fairfield, CT 06828-0001.We are one of the largest and most diversified technology and financial services corporations in the world. With products and services ranging from aircraft engines, power generation, water processing, and household appliances to medical imaging, business and consumer financing and industrial products, we serve customers in more than 100 countries and employ approximately 301,000 people worldwide. Prior to January 28, 2011, we also operated a media company, NBC Universal, Inc. (NBCU). Effective January 28, 2011, we hold a 49% interest in a media entity that includes the NBC Universal businesses. See the GE Corporate Items and Eliminations section of this Item for additional information. Since our incorporation in 1892, we have developed or acquired new technologies and services that have broadened and changed considerably the scope of our activities.In virtually all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we believe that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in which we participate. The NBC Television Network, which became part of the media entity referred to above as of January 28, 2011, is a major U.S. commercial broadcast television network. NBC Universal also competes with other film and television programming producers and distributors, cable/satellite television networks and theme park operators. The businesses in which GECS engages are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks, broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer loan companies, independent finance companies and finance companies associated with manufacturers.On February 22, 2012, we merged our wholly-owned subsidiary, GECS, with and into GECS’ wholly-owned subsidiary, GECC.  The merger simplified our financial services’ corporate structure by consolidating financial services entities and assets within our organization and simplifying Securities and Exchange Commission and regulatory reporting. Upon the merger, GECC became the surviving corporation and assumed all of GECS’ rights and obligations and became wholly-owned directly by General Electric. Our financial services segment, GE Capital, will continue to comprise the continuing operations of GECC, which now includes the run-off insurance operations previously held and managed in GECS. References to GECS, GECC and the GE Capital segment in this Form 10-K Report relate to the entities or segment as they existed during 2011 and do not reflect the February 22, 2012 merger.  (3)  This document contains “forward-looking statements” – that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” or “will.” Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include: current economic and financial conditions, including volatility in interest and exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets; potential market disruptions or other impacts arising in the United States or Europe from developments in the European sovereign debt situation; the impact of conditions in the financial and credit markets on the availability and cost of General Electric Capital Corporation’s (GECC) funding and on our ability to reduce GECC’s asset levels as planned; the impact of conditions in the housing market and unemployment rates on the level of commercial and consumer credit defaults; changes in Japanese consumer behavior that may affect our estimates of liability for excess interest refund claims (Grey Zone); our ability to maintain our current credit rating and the impact on our funding costs and competitive position if we do not do so; the adequacy of our cash flow and earnings and other conditions which may affect our ability to pay our quarterly dividend at the planned level; the level of demand and financial performance of the major industries we serve, including, without limitation, air and rail transportation, energy generation, real estate and healthcare; the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of financial services regulation; strategic actions, including acquisitions, joint ventures and dispositions and our success in completing announced transactions and integrating acquired businesses; the impact of potential information technology or data security breaches; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business and competitive nature. These uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. These uncertainties are described in more detail in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K Report. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.Operating Segments Segment revenue and profit information and additional financial data and commentary on recent financial results for operating segments are provided in the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.Operating businesses that are reported as segments include Energy Infrastructure, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation, Home & Business Solutions and GE Capital. Net earnings of GECS and the effect of transactions between segments are eliminated to arrive at total consolidated data. A summary description of each of our operating segments follows.Effective January 1, 2011, we reorganized the former Technology Infrastructure segment into three segments – Aviation, Healthcare and Transportation. The results of the Aviation, Healthcare and Transportation businesses were unaffected by this reorganization and we began reporting these as separate segments beginning with our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011. Results for 2011 and prior periods in this Form 10-K Report are reported on this basis.On February 22, 2012, we merged our wholly-owned subsidiary, GECS, with and into GECS’ wholly-owned subsidiary, GECC.  Our financial services segment, GE Capital, will continue to comprise the continuing operations of GECC, which now includes the run-off insurance operations previously held and managed in GECS. References to the GE Capital segment in this Form 10-K Report relate to the segment as it existed during 2011 and does not reflect the February 22, 2012 merger.We also continue our longstanding practice of providing supplemental information for certain businesses within the segments.  (4)  Energy Infrastructure Energy Infrastructure (29.7%, 25.1% and 26.3% of consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively) is a leader in the field of development, implementation and improvement of products and technologies that harness resources such as wind, oil, gas and water.Our operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa.To better serve Oil & Gas customers, Energy’s Measurement & Control business was moved to Oil & Gas in October 2011.

We also provide customer-focused solutions centered on the delivery and control of electric power, and market a wide variety of commercial lighting systems. Energy also provides protection and control, communications, power sensing and power quality products and services that increase the reliability of electrical power networks and critical equipment and offering wireless data transmission.  (5)  Energy is party to revenue sharing programs that share the financial results of certain aeroderivative lines. These businesses are controlled by Energy, but counterparties have an agreed share of revenues as well as development and component production responsibilities. At December 31, 2011, such counterparty interests ranged from 17% to 48% of various programs; associated distributions to such counterparties are accounted for as costs of production.Worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. Demand for power generation is global and, as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business. The balance of regional growth and demand side management are important factors to evaluate as we plan for future development.Oil & Gas Our technology helps oil and gas companies make more efficient and sustainable use of the world's energy resources.Oil & Gas supplies mission critical equipment for the global oil and gas industry, used in applications spanning the entire value chain from drilling and completion through production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline compression, pipeline inspection, and including downstream processing in refineries and petrochemical plants. The business designs and manufactures surface and subsea drilling and production systems, equipment for floating production platforms, compressors, turbines, turboexpanders, high pressure reactors, industrial power generation and a broad portfolio of auxiliary equipment.To ensure that the installed base is maintained at peak condition, our service business has over 40 service centers and workshops in the world's main oil and gas extraction and production regions. The business also provides upgrades to customers’ machines, using the latest available technology, to extend production capability and environmental performance. We also provide pipeline integrity solutions, sensor-based measurement, inspection, asset condition monitoring, controls, and radiation measurement solutions. Oil & Gas also offers integrated solutions using sensors for temperature, pressure, moisture, gas and flow rate as well as non-destructive testing inspection equipment, including radiographic, ultrasonic, remote visual and eddy current.On February 4, 2011 and April 26, 2011, we completed the acquisitions of Wellstream PLC and the Well Support division of John Wood Group PLC, respectively.  Wellstream PLC expands the Oil & Gas portfolio with flexible subsea risers and flow lines. The Well Support division of John Wood Group PLC adds equipment, including electrical submersible pumps, that helps extract more oil and gas from mature fields. On February 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Dresser, Inc. which broadens the Oil & Gas product portfolio in control and relief valves, measurement, regulation and control solutions for gas and fuel distributions.For information about orders and backlog, see the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Aviation Aviation (12.8%, 11.8% and 12.1% of consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively) is one of the world’s leading providers of jet engines and related services with operations in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.Aviation produces, sells and services jet engines, turboprop and turbo shaft engines, and related replacement parts for use in military and commercial aircraft. Our military engines are used in a wide variety of aircraft including fighters, bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as marine applications, and our commercial engines power aircraft in all categories of range: short/medium, intermediate and long-range, as well as executive and regional aircraft. We also produce and market engines through CFM International, a company jointly owned by GE and Snecma, a subsidiary of SAFRAN of France, and Engine Alliance, LLC, a company jointly owned by GE and the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation. New engines are also being designed and marketed in joint ventures with Rolls-Royce Group plc and Honda Aero, Inc., a division of Honda Motor Co., Ltd.  (6)  Aviation is party to agreements in which the financial results, as well as production responsibilities, of certain aircraft and marine engine lines are shared. These agreements take the form of both joint ventures and revenue sharing programs.Joint ventures market and sell particular aircraft engine lines, but require negligible direct investment because the venture parties conduct essentially all of the development, production, assembly and aftermarket support activities. Under these agreements, Aviation supplies certain engine components and retains related intellectual property rights. The CFM56 engine line is the product of CFM International and the GP7000 engine line is the product of Engine Alliance, LLC.Revenue sharing programs are a standard form of cooperation for specific product programs in the aviation industry. These businesses are controlled by Aviation, but counterparties have an agreed share of revenues as well as development and component production responsibilities. At December 31, 2011, such counterparty interests ranged from 2% to 49% of various programs; associated distributions to such counterparties are accounted for as costs of production.Aviation also produces global aerospace systems and equipment, including airborne platform computing systems, power generation and distribution products, mechanical actuation products and landing gear, plus various engine components for use in both military and commercial aircraft.We provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (MRO), including sales of replacement parts for many models of engines and repair and overhaul of engines manufactured by competitors. These MRO services are often provided under long-term maintenance contracts.The worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and MRO (including parts sales) is intense. Both U.S. and export markets are important. Product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. Our products and services are subject to a number of regulatory standards.Potential sales for any engine are limited by, among other things, its technological lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance in technology, the small number of potential customers and the limited number of relevant airframe applications. Aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and airline procurement cycles, although these cycles differ from each other.For information about orders and backlog, see the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Healthcare Healthcare (12.3%, 11.3% and 10.4% of consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively) is one of the world’s leading providers of essential healthcare technologies to developed, developing and emerging countries.  Our operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.  (7)  Healthcare has expertise in medical imaging and information technologies, medical diagnostics, patient monitoring systems, disease research, drug discovery and biopharmaceutical manufacturing technologies.

We offer one of the largest original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service organizations in the appliances industry, providing in-home repair and aftermarket parts.We also manufacture, source and sell a variety of lamp products for commercial, industrial and consumer markets, including full lines of incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, high-intensity discharge, light-emitting diode, automotive and miniature products.Intelligent Platforms Intelligent Platforms provides plant automation, hardware, software and embedded computing systems including advanced software, controllers, embedded systems, motion control and operator interfaces.We have global operations located in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America.GE Capital GE Capital (31.0%, 31.0% and 31.7% of consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively) businesses offer a broad range of financial services and products worldwide for businesses of all sizes. Services include commercial loans and leases, fleet management, financial programs, home loans, credit cards, personal loans and other financial services. GE Capital also develops strategic partnerships and joint ventures that utilize GE’s industry-specific expertise in aviation, energy, infrastructure, healthcare and media to capitalize on market-specific opportunities.During 2011, GE Capital provided approximately $104 billion of new financings in the U.S. to various companies, infrastructure projects and municipalities. Additionally, we extended approximately $87 billion of credit to approximately 56 million U.S. consumers. GE Capital provided credit to approximately 19,600 new commercial customers and 37,000 new small businesses in the U.S. during 2011 and ended the period with outstanding credit to more than 284,000 commercial customers and 191,000 small businesses through retail programs in the U.S.  (9)  Within our GE Capital operating segment, we operate the businesses described below along product lines.Our operations are located in North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.GE Capital has communicated its goal of reducing its ending net investment (ENI). To achieve this goal, we are more aggressively focusing our businesses on selective financial services products where we have domain knowledge, broad distribution, and the ability to earn a consistent return on capital, while managing our overall balance sheet size and risk. We have a strategy of exiting those businesses where we are underperforming or that are deemed to be non-strategic. We have completed a number of dispositions in our businesses in the past and will continue to evaluate options going forward.Commercial Lending and Leasing (CLL) CLL provides customers around the world with a broad range of financing solutions. We have particular mid-market expertise, and primarily offer collateralized loans, leases and other financial services to customers, including manufacturers, distributors and end-users for a variety of equipment and major capital assets. These assets include industrial-related facilities and equipment; vehicles; corporate aircraft; and equipment used in many industries, including the construction, manufacturing, transportation, media, communications, entertainment and healthcare industries.In December 2011, we announced that GE Capital Financial Inc., our industrial bank, is acquiring MetLife’s U.S. retail deposit business, which is an established online bank with approximately $7.5 billion in U.S. retail deposits that will allow CLL to better serve its middle-market commercial customers.  The transaction is targeted to close in mid-2012 pending regulatory approval.In 2011, we completed the sale of our CLL marine container leasing business, which consists of our controlling interests in the GE SeaCo joint venture along with other owned marine container assets, and our CLL trailer fleet services business in Mexico.During 2009, we acquired a 100% ownership interest in Interbanca S.p.A., an Italian corporate bank in exchange for the Consumer businesses in Austria and Finland, our credit card and auto businesses in the U.K. and our credit card business in Ireland.In the first quarter of 2009, we deconsolidated Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. (PTL) following our sale of a partial interest in a limited partnership in PTL.We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include commercial banks, investment banks, leasing companies, financing companies associated with manufacturers, and independent finance companies. Competition related to our lending and leasing operations is based on price, that is, interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. More recently, there has been a disruption in the capital markets and in access to and availability of capital as well as the exit of some competitors. Profitability is affected not only by broad economic conditions that affect customer credit quality and the availability and cost of capital funding, but also by successful management of credit risk, operating risk and market risks such as interest rate and currency exchange risks. Success requires high quality risk management systems, customer and industry specific knowledge, diversification, service and distribution channels, strong collateral and asset management knowledge, deal structuring expertise and the ability to reduce costs through technology and productivity.Consumer Consumer, through consolidated entities and associated companies, is a leading provider of financial services to consumers and retailers around the world. We offer a full range of financial products to suit customers’ needs. These products include, on a global basis, private-label credit cards; personal loans; bank cards; auto loans and leases; mortgages; debt consolidation; home equity loans; deposit and other savings products; and small and medium enterprise lending.  (10)  In 2011, we entered into agreements to sell our Consumer Singapore business and our Consumer home lending operations in Australia and New Zealand (Australian Home Lending) and classified them as discontinued operations.  Both dispositions were completed during 2011.In the first quarter of 2011, we sold a substantial portion of our Garanti Bank equity investment.  Following the sale, we hold a 2.25% equity ownership interest, which is classified as an available-for-sale security.In 2010, we entered into agreements to sell our U.S. recreational vehicle and marine equipment financing portfolio (Consumer RV Marine) and Consumer Mexico and classified them as discontinued operations. Both dispositions were completed during 2011.Also, in 2010, we committed to sell our Consumer business in Canada, which was completed during 2011; and we purchased sales finance portfolios from Citi Retail Partner Cards, which provides consumer financing programs and related services to small to mid-sized retailers and dealers.In 2009, we completed the sale of our Consumer businesses in Austria and Finland, the credit card and auto businesses in the U.K., and the credit card business in Ireland in exchange for a 100% ownership in Interbanca S.p.A. Also in 2009, we completed the sale of a portion of our Australian residential mortgage business.In June 2009, we increased our ownership to a controlling interest in BAC Credomatic GECF Inc. (BAC) and, in December 2010, completed the sale of BAC. BAC has been classified as a discontinued operation.Our operations are subject to a variety of bank and consumer protection regulations. Further, a number of countries have ceilings on rates chargeable to consumers in financial service transactions. We are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions including commercial banks, leasing companies, consumer loan companies, independent finance companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers, and insurance companies. Industry participants compete on the basis of price, servicing capability, promotional marketing, risk management, and cross selling. The markets in which we operate are also subject to the risks from fluctuations in retail sales, interest and currency exchange rates, and the consumer’s capacity to repay debt.Real Estate Real Estate offers a range of capital and investment solutions, including equity capital for acquisition or development, as well as fixed and floating rate mortgages for new acquisitions or re-capitalizations of commercial real estate worldwide. Our business finances, with both equity and loan structures, the acquisition, refinancing and renovation of office buildings, apartment buildings, retail facilities, hotels, parking facilities and industrial properties. Our typical real estate loans are intermediate term, senior, fixed or floating-rate, and are secured by existing income-producing commercial properties. We invest in, and provide restructuring financing for, portfolios of commercial mortgage loans, limited partnerships and tax-exempt bonds.We own and operate a global portfolio of real estate with the objective of maximizing property cash flows and asset values. In the normal course of our business operations, we sell certain real estate equity investments when it is economically advantageous for us to do so. However, as real estate values are affected by certain forces beyond our control (e.g., market fundamentals and demographic conditions), it is difficult to predict with certainty the level of future sales, sales prices, impairments or write-offs.Our competitors include banks, financial institutions, real estate companies, real estate investment funds and other financial companies. Competition in our equity investment business is primarily based on price, and competition in our lending business is primarily based on interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. As we compete globally, our success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business.  (11)  Energy Financial Services Energy Financial Services invests in long-lived, capital-intensive energy projects and companies by providing structured equity, debt, leasing, partnership financing, project finance and broad-based commercial finance. We also invest in early-to-later-stage companies that are pursuing new technologies and services in the energy industry. In May 2010, we sold our general partnership interest in Regency Energy Partners L.P. (Regency), a midstream natural gas services provider, and retained a limited partnership interest. This resulted in the deconsolidation of Regency.We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include banks, financial institutions, energy companies, and other finance and leasing companies. Competition is primarily based on price, that is, interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. As we compete globally, our success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business.GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) GECAS engages in commercial aircraft leasing and finance, delivering fleet and financing services to companies across the spectrum of the aviation industry. Our product offerings include leases and secured loans on commercial passenger aircraft, freighters and regional jets; engine leasing and financing services; aircraft parts solutions; and airport equity and debt financing.

Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, banks, financial institutions, equity investors, and other finance and leasing companies. Competition is based on lease rate financing terms, aircraft delivery dates, condition and availability, as well as available capital demand for financing.GECC Corporate Items and Eliminations GECC Corporate Items and Eliminations primarily include unallocated Treasury and Tax operations; Trinity, a group of sponsored special purpose entities; the effects of eliminating transactions between GE Capital’s five operating businesses; underabsorbed corporate overhead; and certain non-allocated amounts determined by the GECC Chairman.GE Corporate Items and Eliminations GE Corporate Items and Eliminations includes the results of disposed businesses in which we retain an unconsolidated interest, principal retirement plan costs and underabsorbed corporate overhead, which includes research and development spending (including our Global Research Centers) and costs related to our Global Growth & Operations organization.On January 28, 2011, we transferred the assets of our NBC Universal (NBCU) business and Comcast Corporation (Comcast) transferred certain of its assets to a newly formed entity, NBCUniversal LLC (NBCU LLC). In connection with the transaction, we received cash from Comcast and a 49% interest in NBCU LLC. Prior to this transaction, NBCU operated as a consolidated diversified media and entertainment company focused on the development, production and marketing of entertainment, news and information, sports and other content to a global audience. Following the transaction, we deconsolidated NBCU and we account for our investment in NBCU LLC under the equity method.During 2009, we sold an 81% interest in our safety screening and detection business, GE Homeland Protection, Inc., to SAFRAN, and in the first quarter of 2010, we sold our other remaining Security business. Prior to its sale, it offered security and life safety technologies, including intrusion and access control, video surveillance and sensor monitoring equipment, fire detection and real estate and property control.Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations primarily comprised BAC, GE Money Japan (our Japanese personal loan business, Lake, and our Japanese mortgage and card businesses, excluding our investment in GE Nissen Credit Co., Ltd.), our U.S. mortgage business (WMC), Consumer RV Marine, Consumer Mexico, Consumer Singapore and Australian Home Lending.  (12)  For further information about discontinued operations, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.Geographic Data Geographic data is reported in Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.Additional financial data about our geographic operations is provided in the Geographic Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Orders and Backlog GE Infrastructure equipment orders increased 24% to $50.1 billion at December 31, 2011. Total GE Infrastructure backlog increased 14% to $200.2 billion at December 31, 2011, composed of equipment backlog of $52.7 billion and services backlog of $147.5 billion. Orders constituting backlog may be cancelled or deferred by customers, subject in certain cases to penalties. See the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report for further information.Research and Development GE-funded research and development expenditures were $4.6 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.3 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, research and development funding from customers, principally the U.S. government, totaled $0.8 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Aviation accounts for the largest share of GE’s research and development expenditures with funding from both GE and customer funds. Energy Infrastructure’s Energy business and Healthcare also made significant expenditures funded primarily by GE.Environmental Matters Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws. We are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately $0.3 billion in 2011, $0.2 billion in 2010 and $0.3 billion in 2009. We presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about $0.4 billion for each of the next two years.In 2006, we entered into a consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to dredge PCB-containing sediment from the upper Hudson River. The consent decree provided that the dredging would be performed in two phases. Phase 1 was completed in May through November of 2009. Between Phase 1 and Phase 2 there was an intervening peer review by an independent panel of national experts. The panel evaluated the performance of Phase 1 dredging operations with respect to Phase 1 Engineering Performance Standards and recommended proposed changes to the standards. On December 17, 2010, EPA issued its decision setting forth the final performance standards for Phase 2 of the Hudson River dredging project, incorporating aspects of the recommendations from the independent peer review panel and from GE. In December 2010, we agreed to perform Phase 2 of the project in accordance with the final performance standards set by EPA and increased our reserve by $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 to account for the probable and estimable costs of completing Phase 2. In 2011, we completed the first year of Phase 2 dredging and commenced work on planned upgrades to the Hudson River wastewater processing facility.  Based on the results from 2011 dredging and our best professional engineering judgment, we believe that our current reserve continues to reflect our probable and estimable costs for the remainder of Phase 2 of the dredging project.  (13)  Employees and Employee Relations At year-end 2011, General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates employed approximately 301,000 persons, of whom approximately 131,000 were employed in the United States. For further information about employees, see Part II, Item 6. “Selected Financial Data” of this Form 10-K Report.Approximately 15,800 GE manufacturing and service employees in the United States are represented for collective bargaining purposes by a total of approximately 108 different union local bargaining units. A majority of such employees are represented by union locals that are affiliated with, and bargain in coordination with, the IUE-CWA, The Industrial Division of the Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO, CLC. During 2011, we negotiated four-year agreements with most of our U.S. unions.  These agreements modestly increase ongoing costs over the term of the contracts on an aggregate basis.  However, the agreements also implement new features that focus on cost containment for health and pension plans.  Beginning January 1, 2012, all production employees will participate in a new consumer-directed health plan.  In addition, production employees who commence service on or after that date will not be eligible to participate in the GE Pension Plan, but will participate in a defined contribution retirement plan.Other GE affiliates are parties to labor contracts with various labor unions, also with varying terms and expiration dates, that cover approximately 3,400 employees.Executive Officers See Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” of this Form 10-K Report for information about Executive Officers of the Registrant.Other Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for our operations. We have not been adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials.We own, or hold licenses to use, numerous patents. New patents are continuously being obtained through our research and development activities as existing patents expire. Patented inventions are used both within the Company and are licensed to others, but no operating segment is substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.Sales of goods and services to agencies of the U.S. Government as a percentage of revenues follow.  % of Consolidated Revenues % of GE Revenues  2011  2010  2009  2011  2010  2009                     Total sales to U.S. Government Agencies 3 % 3 % 4 % 4 % 5 % 5 %Aviation segment                     defense-related sales 3   3   3   4   4   4  GE is a trademark and service mark of General Electric Company.The Company’s Internet address is www.ge.com.

2013-02-26T22:17:59Z,financialEntities/params;cik=40545,"Item 1. Business General Unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms “GE” and “GECC” on the basis of consolidation described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report. Also, unless otherwise indicated by the context, “General Electric” means the parent company, General Electric Company (the Company).General Electric’s address is 1 River Road, Schenectady, NY 12345-6999; we also maintain executive offices at 3135 Easton Turnpike, Fairfield, CT 06828-0001.We are one of the largest and most diversified infrastructure and financial services corporations in the world. With products and services ranging from aircraft engines, power generation, oil and gas production equipment, and household appliances to medical imaging, business and consumer financing and industrial products, we serve customers in more than 100 countries and employ approximately 305,000 people worldwide. Since our incorporation in 1892, we have developed or acquired new technologies and services that have broadened and changed considerably the scope of our activities.In virtually all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we believe that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in which we participate. The businesses in which General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC) engages are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks, broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer loan companies, independent finance companies and finance companies associated with manufacturers.On February 22, 2012, we merged our wholly-owned subsidiary, General Electric Capital Services, Inc. (GECS), with and into GECS’ wholly-owned subsidiary, GECC. The merger simplified our financial services’ corporate structure by consolidating financial services entities and assets within our organization and simplifying Securities and Exchange Commission and regulatory reporting. Upon completion of the merger, (i) all outstanding shares of GECC common stock were cancelled, (ii) all outstanding GECS common stock and all GECS preferred stock held by the Company were converted into an aggregate of 1,000 shares of GECC common stock, and (iii) all treasury shares of GECS and all outstanding preferred stock of GECS held by GECC were cancelled. As a result, GECC became the surviving corporation, assumed all of GECS’ rights and obligations and became wholly-owned directly by the Company.Because we wholly-owned both GECS and GECC, the merger was accounted for as a transfer of assets between entities under common control. Transfers of net assets or exchanges of shares between entities under common control are accounted for at historical value, and as if the transfer occurred at the beginning of the period.Prior to January 28, 2011, we also operated a media company, NBC Universal, Inc. (NBCU). Effective January 28, 2011, we held a 49% interest in a media entity that includes the NBC Universal businesses. On February 12, 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell our remaining 49% common equity interest to Comcast Corporation, as well as the NBCU floors in 30 Rockefeller Center, for $18.1 billion. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2013.   (3)   Forward-Looking Statements This document contains “forward-looking statements” – that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” or “will.” Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include: current economic and financial conditions, including volatility in interest and exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets; potential market disruptions or other impacts arising in the United States or Europe from developments in sovereign debt situations; the impact of conditions in the financial and credit markets on the availability and cost of General Electric Capital Corporation’s (GECC) funding and on our ability to reduce GECC’s asset levels as planned; the impact of conditions in the housing market and unemployment rates on the level of commercial and consumer credit defaults; changes in Japanese consumer behavior that may affect our estimates of liability for excess interest refund claims (GE Money Japan); pending and future mortgage securitization claims and litigation in connection with WMC, which may affect our estimates of liability, including possible loss estimates; our ability to maintain our current credit rating and the impact on our funding costs and competitive position if we do not do so; the adequacy of our cash flows and earnings and other conditions which may affect our ability to pay our quarterly dividend at the planned level or to repurchase shares at planned levels; GECC’s ability to pay dividends to GE at the planned level; our ability to convert pre-order commitments into orders; the level of demand and financial performance of the major industries we serve, including, without limitation, air and rail transportation, energy generation, real estate and healthcare; the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of financial services regulation; our capital allocation plans, as such plans may change and affect planned share repurchases and strategic actions, including acquisitions, joint ventures and dispositions; our success in completing announced transactions and integrating acquired businesses; the impact of potential information technology or data security breaches; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business and competitive nature. These uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. These uncertainties are described in more detail in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K Report. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.Operating Segments Segment revenue and profit information and additional financial data and commentary on recent financial results for operating segments are provided in the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.Operating businesses that are reported as segments include Power & Water, Oil & Gas, Energy Management, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation, Home & Business Solutions and GE Capital. Net earnings of GECC and the effect of transactions between segments are eliminated to arrive at total consolidated data. A summary description of each of our operating segments follows.On February 22, 2012, we merged our wholly-owned subsidiary, GECS, with and into GECS’ wholly-owned subsidiary, GECC. Our financial services segment, GE Capital, continues to comprise the continuing operations of GECC, which now include the run-off insurance operations previously held and managed in GECS. Unless otherwise indicated, references to GECC and the GE Capital segment in this Form 10-K Report relate to the entity or segment as they exist subsequent to the February 22, 2012 merger.Effective October 1, 2012, we reorganized the former Energy Infrastructure segment into three segments – Power & Water, Oil & Gas and Energy Management and we began reporting these as separate segments beginning with this Form 10-K Report. We also reorganized our Home & Business Solutions segment by transferring our Intelligent Platforms business to Energy Management. Results for 2012 and prior periods in this Form 10-K Report are reported on this basis.  (4)   We also continue our longstanding practice of providing supplemental information about the businesses within GE Capital.Power & Water Power & Water (19.2%, 17.4% and 16.6% of consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively) is a leader in the field of development, implementation and improvement of products and technologies that harness resources such as wind, oil, gas and water to produce electric power.Our operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa.Power & Water serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide with products and services related to energy production. We sell gas turbines and generators that are used principally in power plants for generation of electricity and for industrial cogeneration and mechanical drive applications. We are a leading provider of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology design and development. IGCC systems convert coal and other hydrocarbons into synthetic gas that is used as the primary fuel for gas turbines in combined-cycle systems. IGCC systems produce fewer air pollutants compared with traditional pulverized coal power plants. We sell steam turbines and generators to the electric utility industry and to private industrial customers for cogeneration applications. We offer wind turbines as part of our renewable energy portfolio, which also includes solar technology. We also sell aircraft engine derivatives for use as industrial power sources. Nuclear reactors, fuel and support services for both new and installed boiling water reactors are offered through joint ventures with Hitachi and Toshiba. We provide our customers with solutions to meet their needs through a broad portfolio of aftermarket services, including equipment upgrades, long-term maintenance service agreements, repairs, equipment installation, monitoring and diagnostics, asset management and performance optimization tools, remote performance testing and Dry Low NOx (DLN) tuning. We continue to invest in advanced technology development that will provide more value to our customers and more efficient solutions that comply with today’s strict environmental regulations.Power & Water also offers water treatment solutions for industrial and municipal water systems including the supply and related services of specialty chemicals, water purification systems, pumps, valves, filters and fluid handling equipment for improving the performance of water, wastewater and process systems, including mobile treatment systems and desalination processes.On February 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Dresser, Inc., which broadened the product portfolio with technologies for gas engines.Power & Water is party to revenue sharing programs that share the financial results of certain aeroderivative lines. These businesses are controlled by Power & Water, but counterparties have an agreed share of revenues as well as development and component production responsibilities. At December 31, 2012, such counterparty interests ranged from 16% to 49% of various programs; associated distributions to such counterparties are accounted for as costs of production.Worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. Demand for power generation is global and, as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business. The balance of regional growth and demand side management are important factors to evaluate as we plan for future development.For information about orders and backlog, see the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Oil & Gas Oil & Gas (10.3%, 9.2% and 6.3% of consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively) helps oil and gas companies make more efficient and sustainable use of the world's energy resources.Our operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, South America and Africa.  (5)   Oil & Gas supplies mission critical equipment for the global oil and gas industry, used in applications spanning the entire value chain from drilling and completion through production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline compression, pipeline inspection, and downstream processing in refineries and petrochemical plants.

Oil & Gas also offers integrated solutions using sensors for temperature, pressure, moisture, gas and flow rate as well as non-destructive testing inspection equipment, including radiographic, ultrasonic, remote visual and eddy current.On February 4, 2011 and April 26, 2011, we completed the acquisitions of Wellstream PLC and the Well Support division of John Wood Group PLC, respectively.  Wellstream PLC expands the Oil & Gas portfolio with flexible subsea risers and flow lines. The Well Support division of John Wood Group PLC adds equipment, including electrical submersible pumps, that helps extract more oil and gas from mature fields. On February 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Dresser, Inc. which broadens the Oil & Gas product portfolio in control and relief valves, measurement, regulation and control solutions for gas and fuel distributions.Demand for oil and gas equipment and services is global and, as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business. The balance of regional growth and demand side management are important factors to evaluate as we plan for future development.For information about orders and backlog, see the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Energy Management Energy Management (5.0%, 4.4% and 3.5% of consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively) designs, manufactures and services leading technology solutions for the delivery, management, conversion and optimization of electrical power for customers across multiple energy-intensive industries.Our operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.Energy Management provides integrated electrical products and systems used to distribute, protect and control energy and equipment.

(Lineage Power) and Converteam, respectively. The acquisition of Lineage Power, a provider of high-efficiency power conversion infrastructure technology and services for the telecommunications and datacenter industries, continues the expansion of Energy’s offerings from the electric grid to datacenters, cell towers, routers, servers and circuit board electronics. Converteam, a provider of electrification and automation equipment and systems, adds significant product and service capabilities in power electronics, industrial automation and process controls.For information about orders and backlog, see the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Aviation Aviation (13.6%, 12.8% and 11.8% of consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively) is one of the world’s leading providers of jet engines and related services with operations in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.Aviation produces, sells and services jet engines, turboprop and turbo shaft engines, and related replacement parts for use in military and commercial aircraft. Our military engines are used in a wide variety of aircraft including fighters, bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as marine applications, and our commercial engines power aircraft in all categories of range: short/medium, intermediate and long-range, as well as executive and regional aircraft. We also produce and market engines through CFM International, a company jointly owned by GE and Snecma, a subsidiary of SAFRAN of France, and Engine Alliance, LLC, a company jointly owned by GE and the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies Corporation. New engines are also being designed and marketed in a joint venture with Honda Aero, Inc., a division of Honda Motor Co., Ltd.Aviation is party to agreements in which the financial results, as well as production responsibilities, of certain aircraft and marine engine lines are shared. These agreements take the form of both joint ventures and revenue sharing programs.Joint ventures market and sell particular aircraft engine lines, but require negligible direct investment because the venture parties conduct essentially all of the development, production, assembly and aftermarket support activities. Under these agreements, Aviation supplies certain engine components and retains related intellectual property rights. The CFM56 engine line is the product of CFM International and the GP7000 engine line is the product of Engine Alliance, LLC.Revenue sharing programs are a standard form of cooperation for specific product programs in the aviation industry. These businesses are controlled by Aviation, but counterparties have an agreed share of revenues as well as development and component production responsibilities. At December 31, 2012, such counterparty interests ranged from 1% to 47% of various programs; associated distributions to such counterparties are accounted for as costs of production.Aviation also produces global aerospace systems and equipment, including airborne platform computing systems, power generation and distribution products, mechanical actuation products and landing gear, plus various engine components for use in both military and commercial aircraft.We provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (MRO), including sales of replacement parts for many models of engines and repair and overhaul of engines manufactured by competitors. These MRO services are often provided under long-term maintenance contracts.On December 21, 2012, we announced an agreement to purchase the aviation business of Avio S.p.A., a manufacturer of aviation propulsion components and systems, for $4.3 billion.  (7)   The worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and MRO (including parts sales) is intense. Both U.S. and export markets are important. Product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. Our products and services are subject to a number of regulatory standards.Potential sales for any engine are limited by, among other things, its technological lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance in technology, the relatively small number of potential customers and the limited number of relevant airframe applications. Aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and airline procurement cycles, although these cycles differ from each other.For information about orders and backlog, see the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Healthcare Healthcare (12.4%, 12.3% and 11.3% of consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively) is one of the world’s leading providers of essential healthcare technologies to developed, developing and emerging countries.  Our operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia.Healthcare has expertise in medical imaging and information technologies, medical diagnostics, patient monitoring systems, disease research, drug discovery and biopharmaceutical manufacturing technologies.

Services include commercial loans and leases, fleet management, financial programs, home loans, credit cards, personal loans and other financial services. GE Capital also develops strategic partnerships and joint ventures that utilize GE’s industry-specific expertise in aviation, energy, infrastructure and healthcare to capitalize on market-specific opportunities.During 2012, GE Capital provided approximately $107 billion of new financings in the U.S. to various companies, infrastructure projects and municipalities. Additionally, we extended approximately $96 billion of credit to approximately 57 million U.S. consumers. GE Capital provided credit to approximately 37,100 new commercial customers and 34,000 new small businesses in the U.S. during 2012 and ended the period with outstanding credit to more than 243,000 commercial customers and 201,000 small businesses through retail programs in the U.S.Within our GE Capital operating segment, we operate the businesses described below along product lines.Our operations are located in North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.GE Capital has communicated its goal of reducing its ending net investment (ENI). To achieve this goal, we are more aggressively focusing our businesses on selective financial services products where we have domain knowledge, broad distribution, and the ability to earn a consistent return on capital, while managing our overall balance sheet size and risk. We have a strategy of exiting those businesses that are underperforming or that are deemed to be non-strategic. We have completed a number of dispositions in our businesses in the past and will continue to evaluate options going forward.Commercial Lending and Leasing (CLL) CLL provides customers around the world with a broad range of financing solutions. We have particular mid-market expertise, and primarily offer collateralized loans, leases and other financial services to customers, including manufacturers, distributors and end-users for a variety of equipment and major capital assets. These assets include industrial-related facilities and equipment; vehicles; corporate aircraft; and equipment used in many industries, including the construction, manufacturing, transportation, media, communications, entertainment and healthcare industries.In 2011, we completed the sale of our CLL marine container leasing business, which consists of our controlling interests in the GE SeaCo joint venture along with other owned marine container assets, and our CLL trailer fleet services business in Mexico.We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include commercial banks, investment banks, leasing companies, financing companies associated with manufacturers, and independent finance companies. Competition related to our lending and leasing operations is based on price, that is, interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. In recent years, there has been a disruption in the capital markets and in access to and availability of capital as well as the exit of some competitors. Profitability is affected not only by broad economic conditions that affect customer credit quality and the availability and cost of capital funding, but also by successful management of credit risk, operating risk and market risks such as interest rate and currency exchange risks. Success requires high quality risk management systems, customer and industry specific knowledge, diversification, service and distribution channels, strong collateral and asset management knowledge, deal structuring expertise and the ability to reduce costs through technology and productivity.Consumer Consumer, through consolidated entities and associated companies, is a leading provider of financial services to consumers and retailers around the world. We offer a full range of financial products to suit customers’ needs. These products include, on a global basis, private-label credit cards; personal loans; bank cards; auto loans and leases; mortgages; debt consolidation; home equity loans; deposit and other savings products; and small and medium enterprise lending.  (10)   In January 2013, we acquired the deposit business of MetLife Bank, N.A., which is an online banking platform with approximately $6.4 billion in U.S. retail deposits that will allow us to better serve our customers.In 2011, we entered into agreements to sell our Consumer Singapore business and our Consumer home lending operations in Australia and New Zealand (Australian Home Lending) and classified them as discontinued operations.  Both dispositions were completed during 2011.In the first quarter of 2011, we sold a substantial portion of our Garanti Bank equity investment. During 2012, we sold our remaining equity interest in Garanti Bank, which was classified as an available-for-sale security.In 2010, we entered into agreements to sell our U.S. recreational vehicle and marine equipment financing portfolio (Consumer RV Marine) and Consumer Mexico and classified them as discontinued operations. Both dispositions were completed during 2011.In 2010, we committed to sell our Consumer business in Canada, which was completed during 2011; in 2010, we also purchased sales finance portfolios from Citi Retail Partner Cards, which provides consumer financing programs and related services to small to mid-sized retailers and dealers.Our operations are subject to a variety of bank and consumer protection regulations. Further, a number of countries have ceilings on rates chargeable to consumers in financial service transactions. We are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions including commercial banks, leasing companies, consumer loan companies, independent finance companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers, and insurance companies. Industry participants compete on the basis of price, servicing capability, promotional marketing, risk management, and cross selling. The markets in which we operate are also subject to the risks from fluctuations in retail sales, interest and currency exchange rates, and the consumer’s capacity to repay debt.Real Estate Real Estate offers a range of capital and investment solutions, including equity capital for acquisition or development, as well as fixed and floating rate mortgages for new acquisitions or re-capitalizations of commercial real estate worldwide. Our business finances, with both equity and loan structures, the acquisition, refinancing and renovation of office buildings, apartment buildings, retail facilities, hotels and industrial properties. Our typical real estate loans are intermediate term, senior, fixed or floating-rate, and are secured by existing income-producing commercial properties. We invest in, and provide restructuring financing for, portfolios of commercial mortgage loans, limited partnerships and tax-exempt bonds.We own and operate a global portfolio of real estate with the objective of maximizing property cash flows and asset values. In the normal course of our business operations we sell certain real estate equity investments when it is economically advantageous for us to do so. However, as real estate values are affected by certain forces beyond our control (e.g., market fundamentals and demographic conditions), it is difficult to predict with certainty the level of future sales, sales prices, impairments or write-offs.In 2012, we completed the sale of a portion of our Business Properties portfolio (Business Property), including certain commercial loans, the origination and servicing platforms and the servicing rights on loans previously securitized by GECC. The portion retained comprises our owner-occupied/credit tenant portfolio.Our competitors include banks, financial institutions, real estate companies, real estate investment funds and other financial companies. Competition in our equity investment business is primarily based on price, and competition in our lending business is primarily based on interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. As we compete globally, our success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business.  (11)    Energy Financial Services Energy Financial Services invests in long-lived, capital-intensive energy projects and companies by providing structured equity, debt, leasing, partnership financing, project finance and broad-based commercial finance. We also invest in early-to-later-stage companies that are pursuing new technologies and services in the energy industry. In May 2010, we sold our general partnership interest in Regency Energy Partners L.P. (Regency), a midstream natural gas services provider, and retained a limited partnership interest. This resulted in the deconsolidation of Regency.We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include banks, financial institutions, energy companies, and other finance and leasing companies. Competition is primarily based on price, that is, interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. As we compete globally, our success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business.GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) GECAS engages in commercial aircraft leasing and finance, delivering fleet and financing services to companies across the spectrum of the aviation industry. Our product offerings include leases and secured loans on commercial passenger aircraft, freighters and regional jets; engine leasing and financing services; aircraft parts solutions; and airport equity and debt financing. We also co-sponsor an infrastructure private equity fund, which invests in large infrastructure projects including gateway airports.We operate in a highly competitive environment.

Business General Unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms “GE” and “GECC” on the basis of consolidation described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report. Also, unless otherwise indicated by the context, “General Electric” means the parent company, General Electric Company (the Company).General Electric’s address is 1 River Road, Schenectady, NY 12345-6999; we also maintain executive offices at 3135 Easton Turnpike, Fairfield, CT 06828-0001.We are one of the largest and most diversified infrastructure and financial services corporations in the world. With products and services ranging from aircraft engines, power generation, oil and gas production equipment, and household appliances to medical imaging, business and consumer financing and industrial products, we serve customers in more than 100 countries and employ approximately 307,000 people worldwide. Since our incorporation in 1892, we have developed or acquired new technologies and services that have broadened and changed considerably the scope of our activities.In virtually all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we believe that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in which we participate. The businesses in which General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC) engages are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks, broker-dealers, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer loan companies, independent finance companies and finance companies associated with manufacturers.On November 15, 2013, we announced that we intend to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) of our North American Retail Finance business (Retail Finance) as a first step in a staged exit from that business. We plan to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the first quarter of 2014 and complete the IPO later in 2014. We plan to issue up to 20% of the equity of Retail Finance in the IPO, in exchange for cash that will be used to increase the capital of the new company. We currently intend to complete our exit from Retail Finance in 2015 through a split-off transaction, by making a tax-free distribution of our remaining interest in Retail Finance to electing GE stockholders in exchange for shares of GE’s common stock. We may also decide to exit by selling or otherwise distributing or disposing of all or a portion of our remaining interest in the Retail Finance shares.Prior to January 28, 2011, we also operated a media company, NBC Universal, Inc. (NBCU). Effective January 28, 2011, we held a 49% interest in a media entity that included the NBC Universal businesses. On March 19, 2013, we completed the sale of our remaining 49% common equity interest to Comcast Corporation.   (3)   Forward-Looking Statements This document contains “forward-looking statements” – that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” or “will.” Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include: current economic and financial conditions, including volatility in interest and exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets; potential market disruptions or other impacts arising in the United States or Europe from developments in sovereign debt situations; the impact of conditions in the financial and credit markets on the availability and cost of General Electric Capital Corporation’s (GECC) funding and on our ability to reduce GECC’s asset levels as planned; the impact of conditions in the housing market and unemployment rates on the level of commercial and consumer credit defaults; pending and future mortgage securitization claims and litigation in connection with WMC, which may affect our estimates of liability, including possible loss estimates; our ability to maintain our current credit rating and the impact on our funding costs and competitive position if we do not do so; the adequacy of our cash flows and earnings and other conditions which may affect our ability to pay our quarterly dividend at the planned level or to repurchase shares at planned levels; GECC’s ability to pay dividends to GE at the planned level; our ability to convert pre-order commitments/wins into orders; the price we realize on orders since commitments/wins are stated at list prices; the level of demand and financial performance of the major industries we serve, including, without limitation, air and rail transportation, energy generation, real estate and healthcare; the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of financial services regulation; our capital allocation plans, as such plans may change including with respect to the timing and size of share repurchases, acquisitions, joint ventures, dispositions and other strategic actions; our success in completing announced transactions and integrating acquired businesses; our ability to complete the staged exit from our North American Retail Finance business as planned; the impact of potential information technology or data security breaches; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business and competitive nature. These uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. These uncertainties are described in more detail in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K Report. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.Operating Segments Segment revenue and profit information and additional financial data and commentary on recent financial results for operating segments are provided in the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.Operating businesses that are reported as segments include Power & Water, Oil & Gas, Energy Management, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation, Appliances & Lighting and GE Capital. Net earnings of GECC and the effect of transactions between segments are eliminated to arrive at total consolidated data. A summary description of each of our operating segments follows. We also continue our longstanding practice of providing supplemental information about the businesses within GE Capital.Power & Water Power & Water (16.9%, 19.3% and 17.5% of consolidated revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively) is a leader in the field of development, implementation and improvement of products and technologies that harness resources such as wind, oil, gas and water to produce electric power.Our operations are located in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and the Middle East.   (4)   Power & Water serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide with products and services related to energy production.

These agreements take the form of both joint ventures and revenue sharing programs.The scope of the joint ventures can range from development through the marketing, sales, production, assembly and aftermarket support of particular products.Revenue sharing programs are a standard form of cooperation for specific product programs in the aviation industry. These programs are controlled by Aviation, but counterparties have an agreed share of revenues as well as development and component production responsibilities. At December 31, 2013, such counterparty interests ranged from 1% to 39% of various programs; associated distributions to such counterparties are accounted for as costs of production.On August 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the aviation business of Avio S.p.A., a manufacturer of aviation propulsion components and systems for $4.4 billion.The worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and MRO (including parts sales) is intense. Both U.S. and export markets are important. Product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. Our products and services are subject to a number of regulatory standards.  (7)   Potential sales for any engine are limited by, among other things, its technological lifetime, which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance in technology, the relatively small number of potential customers and the limited number of relevant airframe applications. Aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and airline procurement cycles, although these cycles differ from each other.For information about orders and backlog, see the Segment Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Healthcare Healthcare (12.5%, 12.5% and 12.3% of consolidated revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively) is one of the world’s leading providers of essential healthcare technologies to developed, developing and emerging countries.

Services include commercial loans and leases, fleet management, financial programs, credit cards, personal loans and other financial services. GE Capital also develops strategic partnerships and joint ventures that utilize GE’s industry-specific expertise in aviation, energy, infrastructure and healthcare to capitalize on market-specific opportunities.During 2013, GE Capital provided approximately $115 billion of new financings in the U.S. to various companies, infrastructure projects and municipalities. Additionally, we extended approximately $105 billion of credit to approximately 61 million U.S. consumers. GE Capital provided credit to approximately 31,200 new commercial customers and 43,000 new small businesses in the U.S. during 2013 and ended the period with outstanding credit to more than 237,000 commercial customers and 212,000 small businesses through retail programs in the U.S.  (9)   GECC is a regulated savings and loan holding company under U.S. law and became subject to Federal Reserve Board (FRB) supervision on July 21, 2011, the one-year anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DFA). In addition, on July 8, 2013, the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designated GECC as a nonbank systemically important financial institution (nonbank SIFI) under the DFA. Many of the rulemakings for supervision of nonbank SIFIs are not final and therefore the exact impact and implementation date remain uncertain. GECC continues to plan for the enhanced prudential standards that will apply to nonbank SIFIs. These DFA rulemakings will require, among other items, enhanced capital and liquidity levels, compliance with the comprehensive capital analysis and review regulations (CCAR), compliance with counterparty credit exposure limits, and the development of a resolution plan for submission to regulators.We have communicated our goal of reducing GE Capital’s ending net investment (ENI), most recently targeting ENI of $300 billion to $350 billion. ENI is a metric used by us to measure the total capital we have invested in our financial services business. GE Capital’s ENI (excluding cash and equivalents) was $380 billion at December 31, 2013. To achieve this goal, we are more aggressively focusing our businesses on selective financial services products where we have deep domain experience, broad distribution, and the ability to earn a consistent return on capital, while managing our overall balance sheet size and risk. We have a strategy of exiting those businesses that are deemed to be non-strategic or that are underperforming. We have completed a number of dispositions in our businesses in the past and will continue to evaluate options going forward.While we are exiting non-core businesses, we are investing in our core businesses in markets where we believe that GECC has deep domain experience and is competitively advantaged. Accordingly, in the short-term, as we reduce our ENI through exiting non-core businesses, the overall level of our future net earnings may be reduced. However, over the long-term, we believe that this strategy will improve our long-term performance through higher returns as we will have a larger concentration of assets in our core businesses, as opposed to the underperforming or non-strategic assets we will be exiting; reduce liquidity risk as we pay down outstanding debt and diversify our sources of funding (with less reliance on the global commercial paper markets and an increase in alternative sources of funding such as deposits); and reduce capital requirements while strengthening capital ratios. Additional information about our liquidity and how we manage this risk can be found in the Financial Resources and Liquidity section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Within our GE Capital operating segment, we operate the businesses described below along product lines.Our operations are located in North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.Commercial Lending and Leasing (CLL) CLL has particular mid-market expertise, and primarily offers secured commercial loans, equipment financing and other financial services to companies across a wide range of industries including construction, retail, manufacturing, transportation, media, communications, technology and healthcare. Equipment financing activities include industrial, medical, fleet vehicles, corporate aircraft, construction, office imaging and many other equipment types.In the first quarter of 2013, we announced the planned disposition of our CLL trailer services business in Europe (CLL Trailer Services) and classified the business as discontinued operations. We completed the sale in the fourth quarter of 2013.In 2011, we completed the sale of our CLL marine container leasing business, which consists of our controlling interests in the GE SeaCo joint venture along with other owned marine container assets, and our CLL trailer fleet services business in Mexico.  (10)   We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include commercial banks, investment banks, leasing companies, financing companies associated with manufacturers, and independent finance companies. Competition related to our lending and leasing operations is based on price, that is, interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. In recent years, there has been a disruption in the capital markets and in access to and availability of capital as well as the exit of some competitors. Profitability is affected not only by broad economic conditions that affect customer credit quality and the availability and cost of capital funding, but also by successful management of credit risk, operating risk and market risks such as interest rate and currency exchange risks. Success requires high-quality risk management systems, customer and industry specific knowledge, diversification, service and distribution channels, strong collateral and asset management knowledge, strong transaction expertise and the ability to reduce costs through technology and productivity.Consumer Consumer, through consolidated entities and associated companies, is a leading provider of financial services to consumers and retailers around the world. We offer a full range of financial products to suit customers’ needs. These products include, on a global basis, private-label credit cards; personal loans; bank cards; auto loans and leases; mortgages; debt consolidation; home equity loans; deposit and other savings products; and small and medium enterprise lending.In the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed a sale of 68.5% of our Swiss consumer finance bank, Cembra Money Bank AG (Cembra), through an IPO; we committed to sell our Consumer banking business in Russia (Consumer Russia) and classified the business as discontinued operations; and we sold our remaining equity interest in the Bank of Ayudhya (Bay Bank).In November 2013, we announced that we intend to pursue an IPO of our North American Retail Finance business (Retail Finance) as a first step in a staged exit from that business. We plan to file a registration statement with the SEC in the first quarter of 2014 and complete the IPO later in 2014.We plan to issue up to 20% of the equity of Retail Finance in the IPO, in exchange for cash that will be used to increase the capital of the new company. We currently intend to complete our exit from Retail Finance in 2015 through a split-off transaction, by making a tax-free distribution of our remaining interest in Retail Finance to electing GE stockholders in exchange for shares of GE’s common stock. We may also decide to exit by selling or otherwise distributing or disposing of all or a portion of our remaining interest in the Retail Finance shares.In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired the deposit business of MetLife Bank, N.A., which is an online banking platform with approximately $6.4 billion in U.S. retail deposits that will allow us to better serve our customers.In 2011, we sold our Consumer Singapore business and our Consumer home lending operations in Australia and New Zealand (Australian Home Lending) and classified them as discontinued operations. Also in 2011, we sold a substantial portion of our Garanti Bank equity investment. During 2012, we sold our remaining equity interest in Garanti Bank, which was classified as an available-for-sale security.Our operations are subject to a variety of bank and consumer protection regulations. Further, a number of countries have ceilings on rates chargeable to consumers in financial service transactions. We are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions including commercial banks, leasing companies, consumer loan companies, independent finance companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers, and insurance companies. Industry participants compete on the basis of price, servicing capability, promotional marketing, risk management, and cross selling. The markets in which we operate are also subject to the risks from fluctuations in retail sales, interest and currency exchange rates, and the consumer’s capacity to repay debt.  (11)   Real Estate Real Estate offers a range of capital and investment solutions, including equity capital for acquisition or development, as well as fixed and floating rate mortgages for new acquisitions or re-capitalizations of commercial real estate worldwide. Our business finances, with both equity and loan structures, the acquisition, refinancing and renovation of office buildings, apartment buildings, retail facilities, hotels, warehouses and industrial properties. Our typical real estate loans are intermediate term, senior, fixed or floating-rate, and are secured by existing income-producing commercial properties. We invest in, and provide restructuring financing for, portfolios of commercial mortgage loans, limited partnerships and tax-exempt bonds.We own and operate a global portfolio of real estate with the objective of maximizing property cash flows and asset values. In the normal course of our business operations we sell certain real estate equity investments when it is economically advantageous for us to do so. However, as real estate values are affected by certain forces beyond our control (e.g., market fundamentals and demographic conditions), it is difficult to predict with certainty the level of future sales, sales prices, impairments or write-offs.During 2013, in conjunction with our initiative to increase our overall real estate lending portfolio and reduce our exposure to real estate equity investments, we acquired certain loan portfolios and sold real estate equity investments when economically advantageous for us to do, including the sale of real estate comprising certain floors located at 30 Rockefeller Center, New York.In 2012, we completed the sale of a portion of our Business Properties portfolio (Business Property), including certain commercial loans, the origination and servicing platforms and the servicing rights on loans previously securitized by GECC. The portion that we retained comprises our owner-occupied/credit tenant portfolio.Our competitors include banks, financial institutions, real estate companies, real estate investment funds and other financial companies. Competition in our equity investment business is primarily based on price, and competition in our lending business is primarily based on interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. As we compete globally, our success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business.Energy Financial Services Energy Financial Services invests in long-lived, capital-intensive energy projects and companies by providing structured equity, debt, leasing, partnership financing, project finance and broad-based commercial finance.We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include banks, financial institutions, energy companies, and other finance and leasing companies. Competition is primarily based on price, that is, interest rates and fees, as well as deal structure and terms. As we compete globally, our success is sensitive to the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business.GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) GECAS, our commercial aircraft financing and leasing business, offers a wide range of aircraft types and financing options, including operating leases and secured debt financing, and also provides productivity solutions including spare engine leasing, airport and airline consulting services, and spare parts financing and management.We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, banks, financial institutions, equity investors, and other finance and leasing companies. Competition is based on lease rate financing terms, aircraft delivery dates, condition and availability, as well as available capital demand for financing.GECC Corporate Items and Eliminations GECC Corporate Items and Eliminations primarily include unallocated Treasury and Tax operations; Trinity, a group of run-off sponsored special purpose entities; the effects of eliminating transactions between GE Capital’s five operating businesses; results of our run-off insurance operations remaining in continuing operations attributable to GECC; unallocated corporate costs; and certain non-allocated amounts determined by the GECC Chairman.  (12)   GE Corporate Items and Eliminations GE Corporate Items and Eliminations includes the results of disposed businesses in which we retain an unconsolidated interest (including NBC Universal LLC until we sold our equity interest in the first quarter of 2013), principal retirement plan costs and unallocated corporate costs, which includes research and development spending (including our Global Research Centers) and costs related to our Global Growth & Operations organization. Corporate Items and Eliminations also includes certain amounts not allocated to GE industrial operating segments because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for external purposes. In this regard, the Chief Executive Officer may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring; rationalization and other similar expenses; acquisition costs and other related charges; technology and product development costs; certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions; and litigation settlements or other charges, responsibility for which preceded the current management team.Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations primarily comprises GE Money Japan (our Japanese personal loan business, Lake, and our Japanese mortgage and card businesses, excluding our investment in GE Nissen Credit Co., Ltd.), our U.S. mortgage business (WMC), our U.S. recreational vehicle and marine equipment financing business (Consumer RV Marine), Consumer Mexico, Consumer Singapore, Australian Home Lending, our Consumer mortgage lending business in Ireland (Consumer Ireland), CLL Trailer Services and Consumer Russia.For further information about discontinued operations, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.Geographic Data Geographic data is provided in the Geographic Operations section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.Orders and Backlog Orders and backlog information is provided in the Segment Operations and Other Information sections in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Research and Development Research and development expenditures information is provided in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and the Other Information section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Environmental Matters Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws. We are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Additional information is provided in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K Report.Employees and Employee Relations At year-end 2013, General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates employed approximately 307,000 persons, of whom approximately 135,000 were employed in the United States.

2008-02-26T19:06:45Z,financialEntities/params;cik=51143,"Item 1. Business:          International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as theComputing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of NewYork. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over80 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is a globally integrated innovationcompany, serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness, efficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws uponthe world's leading systems, software and services capabilities. ** * Description of Business          IBM is a globally integrated enterprise that targets the intersection of technology and effective business. The company seeks to be a partner in its clients'success by enabling their own capacity for distinctive innovation. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness, efficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon theworld's leading systems, software and services capabilities. IBM'S STRATEGY          In IBM's view, today's networked economy has created a global business landscape and a mandate for business change. Integrated global economies have openedmarkets of new opportunity and new sources of skills. The Internet has enabled communication and collaboration across the world and brought with it a new computing model premised on continuous globalconnection. In that landscape, companies can distribute work and technology anywhere in the world.         Giventhese opportunities, IBM is working with its clients to develop new business designs and technical architectures that allow their businesses the flexibility required to compete inthis new landscape. The business is also adjusting its footprint towards emerging geographies, tapping their double-digit growth, providing the technology infrastructure they need, and takingadvantage of the talent pools they provide to better service the company's clients.         IBM'sstrategy addresses this new era and delivers value to its clients through three strategic priorities: Focus on Open Technologies and High-Value Solutions          The PC era has ended, representing a fundamental shift in the technology requirements of the company's clients. IBM is well positioned to provide its enterpriseclients the open technologies and high-value solutions they will need to compete. •IBM is leveraging its leadership position in the convergence of software and services, in SOA, in virtualization, in high-performancechips, in open and modular IT—continuing its shift from commoditizing segments to higher value segments with better profit opportunity.•The company continues to be a leading force in open source solutions to enable its clients to achieve higher levels of interoperability, costefficiency and quality.1 Deliver Integration and Innovation to Clients          Changes in the market have caused IBM's clients to seek flexibility and innovation in everything from technical architecture to their business model. In response,IBM is focused on delivering integration and innovation to its clients—offering them technologies and services that support real value creation. •IBM has a long heritage of transforming the business operations of large enterprises and has earned the trust to be their innovation partner andglobal integrator.•The company has a deep set of global assets and capabilities it is applying to improve services profitability, both for its clients and foritself.Become the Premier Globally Integrated Enterprise          As global networks and technology capabilities change business economics, legacy business designs can quickly become non-competitive. IBM believes aglobally integrated enterprise, designed for this new landscape can compete effectively and will benefit from the opportunities offered. •To reshape its business for the global economy, IBM has replaced vertical hierarchies with horizontally integrated teams.•Across the business, the company has made significant investments in emerging markets, taking core processes and functions that were once managedregionally and shifting them to a globally integrated model.        Lookingforward, IBM is confident it understands the economic shift of globalization, the evolution of the new computing model and the powerful role of innovation in this new landscape.Its uniquecapabilities are well adapted to help the company's clients innovate and compete effectively in the new landscape. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES          The company's major operations comprise a Global Technology Services segment; a Global Business Services segment; a Systems and Technology segment; a Softwaresegment; and a Global Financing segment. 2 Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to clients. Whilesolutions often include industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Contracts for IBM services—commonly referredto as ""signings""—can range from less than one year to over ten years. Within Global Services there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. Global Technology Services (GTS) segment primarily reflects IT infrastructure services and business process services, delivering value through thecompany's global scale, standardization and automation. GTS Capabilities          Strategic Outsourcing Services.    Comprehensive IT services integrated with business insight working with clients to reducecosts and improve productivity through the outsourcing of processes and operations.         Business Transformation Outsourcing.    A range of offerings from standardized processing platforms and Business ProcessOutsourcing through transformational offerings that delivers improved business results to clients through the strategic change and/or operation of the client's business processes, applications andinfrastructure.         Integrated Technology Services.    Services offerings that help clients access, manage and support their technologyinfrastructures, through a combination of skilled resources, software and IBM's knowledge of business processes.         Maintenance.    A number of support services from product maintenance through solution support to maintain and improve theavailability of clients' IT infrastructure.

Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems, processes andapplications across a standard software platform. IBM middleware is designed to open standards which allows the efficient integration of disparate client applications that may have been builtinternally, or provided by package software vendors or system integrators. Operating systems are the software engines that run computers. In addition, Softwareincludes Product Lifecycle Management software which primarily serves the Industrial sector. Approximately two-thirds of external software segment revenue is annuity-based, coming fromrecurring license charges and on-going subscription and support from one-time charge (OTC) arrangements. The remaining one-third of external revenue relates to OTCarrangements, in which the client pays one up-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year of maintenance. The client canalso purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support. While not reported as external revenue, software is also deployed to support servicessolutions.

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS          The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: •Sales and Distribution Organization  •Research, Development and Intellectual Property  •Integrated Operations  Sales and Distribution Organization          The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country based operating units focused on delivering clientvalue. Within these units, client relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients' business performance.These teams deliver value by understanding the client's business and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to develop and implementsolutions for clients.         Bycombining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities andtimely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by leveragingindustry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local Business Partner resources.         Themajority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors: •Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance  •Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences  •Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics  •Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation  •Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities  •Small and Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees  5 Research, Development and Intellectual Property          IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $6 billion for R&D,focusing its investments in high-growth, high-value opportunities. In 2007, the company's investment in R&D was approximately 15 percent of its combined hardware andsoftware revenue. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S. patents in 2007 than any other company. This marks the 15th year in a row that IBM achievedthis distinction.         Inaddition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its growingservices activities. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1 billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are usedexclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. INTEGRATED OPERATIONS          IBM's ability to deliver differentiating innovation to its clients is being greatly enhanced by the company's global integration which is simultaneously givingthe company better economics and deeper capabilities, while eliminating redundancies that were built up over fifty years as a growing multinational enterprise. The company operates in 170 countries,with approximately 69 percent of its employees outside the U.S. As a globally integrated enterprise, the company organizes work based on the right costs, the right skills and the right businessenvironment, integrating deeply with its partners, suppliers and clients. Being global is about gaining access to talent and skills and then scaling them globally to develop new, distinctivecapabilities. The company's integrated operations enable IBM to be the most efficient, responsive and globally integrated enterprise—able to instantly leverage its expertise andcapabilities—anywhere, at any time. Although bound by a common mission and principles, Integrated Operations is comprised of three distinct units, each with very specific objectivesclosely aligned with the IBM businesses they support. Integrated Supply Chain          Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global market conditions, the company continues to derivebusiness value from its own globally integrated supply chain, reinvented as a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients and shareholders. IBM leverages its supply-chain expertisefor clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end supply-chain processes, from procurement tologistics.         IBMspends approximately $38 billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. The company's supply, manufacturing and logistics andcustomer fulfillment operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed to variablecosts. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations, sales force productivity and processes, and these actions have improved client satisfaction. Integrated Technology Delivery          Integrated Technology Delivery (ITD) brings together all of the company's worldwide service delivery capabilities for Strategic Outsourcing with strong local andregional management teams supported by a set of global competencies. ITD leverages the company's global scale and advanced technology to deliver standardized solutions that are automated, repeatableand globally integrated. 6 Throughthe company's global position, clients gain cost advantages, access to industry-leading skills and access to IBM's scale and overall flexibility. ITD manages the world's largestprivately-owned IT infrastructure with employees in over 30 countries supporting over 400 data centers. Integrated Managed Business Process Delivery          Integrated Managed Business Process Delivery (IMBPD) provides highly efficient, world class delivery capabilities in IBM's business process delivery operations,which include Business Transformation Outsourcing, Business Process Outsourcing, Business Process Services and Application on Demand. IMBPD has employees and delivery centers in over 40 countriesworldwide. KEY BUSINESS DRIVERS          The following are some of the key drivers of the company's business. Economic Environment and Corporate Spending Budgets          Global demand for systems, software and services is a key driver of the company's business and financial performance. IBM's diverse set of products and offeringsis designed to provide more consistent results in both strong and weak economic environments. The company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash andincome streams, as well as cyclical transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues totransform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends, focusing on client- or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives          IBM is committed to its transformation to a globally integrated enterprise. The company continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings bytransforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this integration has improvedIBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and led to a sharper focus for the company on learning, development and knowledge sharing. Innovation Initiatives          IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research and development of new products and services, as well as inthe establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. Examples include IBM's leadership positions in the design ofsmaller, faster and energy-efficient semiconductor devices; systems virtualization, Green Data Centers and the design of ""grid"" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power. Open Standards          The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for an on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation acrossall industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task.The broad-based acceptance of open standards—rather than closed, proprietary architectures—also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefitfrom) new technical innovations. IBM's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux, 7 andthe development of Rational software development tools, which can be used to develop and upgrade other companies' software products. Investing in Growth Opportunities          The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise computing—providing technology and transformationservices to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth opportunities as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Areas ofinvestment include strategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, focused client- and industry-specific solutions, maintaining technology leadership and emerging growth countriesworldwide.

connected blu-ray players such as those manufactured by lg electronics and samsungset-top boxes such as tivo and the netflix player by roku game consoles such as microsofts xbox  and planned for later this year tvs from vizio and lg electronics  our core strategy is to grow a large subscription business consisting of dvd by mail and streaming content we offer over  titles on dvd incomparison the  content choices available for streaming are relatively limited we expect to substantially broaden the content choices as more content becomes available to us until such time by bundling dvd and streaming as part of thenetflix subscription we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely comprehensive selection of movies for one low monthly price we believe this creates a competitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service this advantage willdiminish over time as more content becomes available over the internet from competing services by which time we expect to have further developed our other advantages such as brand distribution and our proprietary merchandising platform despitethe growing popularity of internet delivered content we expect that the standard definition dvd along with its high definition successor blu-ray collectively referred to in this annual report as dvd will continue to be the primarymeans by which most netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future however at some point in the future we expect that internet delivery of content to the home will surpass dvd  we promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs including online promotions television and radio advertising package insertsdirect mail and other promotions with third parties these programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period at the end of the free trial period subscribers are automatically enrolled as payingsubscribers unless they cancel their subscription all paying

directly from studios distributors and other suppliers in addition we have more than  content choices licensed for streaming  we ship and receive dvds throughout the united states we maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allows us to provide fast delivery andreturn service to our subscribers  we are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology tominimize operating costs our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business including our web site interface order processing fulfillment operations and customer service we believe that our technology also allows us tomaximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements  we areorganized in a single operating segment all our revenues are generated in the united states and we have no long-lived assets outside the united states substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees  industry overview  motion pictures including moviesand television programs entertainment video are distributed broadly through a variety of channels including movie theaters airlines hotels and in-home in-home distribution channels include dvd rental and retail outlets and websites cable satellite and telecommunication providers offering basic and premium television pay-per-view and video-on-demand vod and internet delivery currently studios distribute their entertainment video content approximatelythree to six months after theatrical release to the home video market three to seven months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and vod one year after theatrical release to premium television and two to three years after theatrical release tobasic cable and network television internet delivered content is made available typically at the same time as pay-per-view or vod however some content such as television shows are often made available for internet viewing shortly after theoriginal airing date the major studios and television networks have continued to experiment with shortened release windows and we anticipate that they will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional windowsincluding releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod we believe however that dvd will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits dvd generates for the studios in the near term  challenges faced by consumers in selecting in-home entertainment video  the continued proliferation of new releases of entertainment video coupled with the availability of a large and growing back catalog of titles on dvdcreate two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles  first despite the large number of available titles on dvd existingsubscription channels and traditional dvd rental outlets stock a limited selection of titles frustrating consumer demand for more choice subscription channels pay-per-view and vod services continue to offer a relatively narrow selection oftitles likewise traditional dvd rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalog titles we believe our selection of over  titles on dvd offers an attractive alternative to thesetraditional channels  second even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available they generally have limited means toeffectively sort through the titles we believe our recommendation service our merchandising practices and our other web site features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences table of contentscompetitive strengths  we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths   comprehensive library of titles we have well established relationships with major studios and distributors enabling us to maintain abroad and deep selection of dvd titles we also offer our subscribers access to a smaller library of titles available for streaming because of our scale national footprint and internet based subscription model we believe that we can efficientlyacquire and provide subscribers a broader selection of dvd titles than dvd rental outlets dvd retailers and cable satellite and telecommunication providers in addition by providing both dvd and streaming content as part of the netflixsubscription we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely comprehensive selection of movies for one low monthly price to maximize our selection of dvd titles

market for in-homeentertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home entertainment video providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for exampleconsumers may subscribe to cable rent a dvd from redbox or blockbuster buy a dvd from wal-mart or amazon download a movie from apple itunes watch a television show on hulucom and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in thesame month new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at a relatively low cost dvds and internet table of contentsdelivery of content represent only two of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing entertainment video in addition the growth in adoptionof dvd and internet delivery of content is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies  our principal competitorsinclude   dvd rental outlets and kiosk services such as blockbuster movie gallery and redbox   video package providers with pay-per-view and vod content including cable providers such as time warner and comcast direct broadcast satellite providers such asdirectv and echostar and

marketing expenses we are a pioneer in the internet delivery of tv shows and movies launching our streaming service in  since this launchwe have developed an ecosystem of internet-connected devices and have licensed increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy tv shows and movies directly on their tvs computers and mobile devices as a result of these efforts wehave experienced growing consumer acceptance of and interest in the delivery of tv shows and movies directly over the internet we believe that the dvd portion of our domestic service will be a fading differentiator to our streaming success prior to july  in the united states our streaming and dvd-by-mail operations were combined and subscribers couldreceive both streaming content and dvds under a single hybrid plan in july  we introduced dvd only plans and separated the combined plans making it necessary for subscribers who wish to receive both dvds-by-mail and streamingcontent to have two separate subscription plans this resulted in a price increase for our members who were taking a combination of our unlimited dvds-by-mail and unlimited streaming services we made a subsequent announcement during the thirdquarter of  concerning the rebranding of our dvd-by-mail service and the separation of the dvd-by-mail and streaming websites the consumer reaction to the price change and to a lesser degree the branding announcement was very negativeleading to significant customer cancellations we subsequently retracted our plans to rebrand our dvd-by-mail service and separate the dvd-by-mail and streaming websites table of contentsin september  we began international operations by offering our streaming service incanada in september  we expanded our streaming service to latin america and the caribbean in january  we launched our streaming service in the uk and ireland we anticipate significant contribution losses in the international streamingsegment in  until we reach our goal of global

three operating segments domestic streaming international streaming and domestic dvd the domestic and international streaming segments deriverevenue from monthly subscription services consisting solely of streaming content the domestic dvd segment derives revenue from monthly subscription services consisting solely of dvd-by-mail for additional information regarding our segments seenote  of item  financial statements and supplementary data  seasonality our subscriber growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations in when consumers buy internet-connected devices and when theytend to increase video watching as a consequence subscriber growth is generally greatest in our fourth and first quarters october through march slowing in our second quarter april through june and then accelerating in our third quarter julythrough september additionally the variable expenses associated with shipments of dvds are impacted by the seasonal nature of dvd usage intellectual property

ready devices currently include blu-ray disc players internet-connected tvs digital video players and game consoles  receive dvds by us mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers after a dvd has been returned we mail the nextavailable dvd in a subscribers queue  our core strategy is to grow a large subscription businessconsisting of streaming and dvd-by-mail content by combining streaming and dvd as part of the netflix subscription we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely compelling selection of movies for one low monthly price we believe this creates acompetitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service this advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the internet from competing services by which time we expect to have further developed ourother advantages such as brand distribution and our proprietary merchandising platform despite the growing popularity of internet delivered content we expect that the standard definition dvd along with its high definition successor blu-raycollectively referred to as dvd will continue to be the primary means by which a majority of netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future however at some point in the future we expect that internet delivery ofcontent to the home will surpass dvd as the primary means by which most netflix subscribers view content  we promote ourservice to consumers through various marketing programs including online promotions tv and radio advertising package inserts direct mail and other promotions with third parties we also engage   table of contentsour consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service these programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period at the end ofthe free trial period subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers unless they cancel their subscription all paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance we believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhancedby the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs  we use ourproprietary recommendation and merchandising technology to determine which titles are presented to a subscriber in doing so we believe we provide our subscribers with a quick and personalized way to find titles they are more likely to enjoy whilealso effectively managing our inventory utilization our merchandising efforts are used throughout our web site and as part of the user interface on many netflix ready devices to determine which titles are displayed to subscribers including thegeneration of lists of similar titles we believe our merchandising efforts create a powerful method for catalog browsing and efficient library utilization  we obtain content through direct purchases revenue sharing agreements and license agreements with studios distributors and other suppliers dvd content is typically obtained through direct purchases orrevenue sharing agreements streaming content is generally licensed for a fixed fee for the term of the license agreement  weship and receive dvds throughout the united states and maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allows us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers we also utilize third party content delivery networks to help usefficiently stream movies and tv episodes in high volume to netflix subscribers over the internet  we are focused on growingour subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology to minimize variable and fixed operating costs within the framework of providing a valuable and compelling user experience our technology isextensively employed to manage and integrate our business including our web site interface order processing fulfillment operations and customer service we believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to runour fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements  we are organized in a single operatingsegment we currently generate all our revenues in the united states although we plan to launch a limited international expansion with a streaming subscription service in  substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscriptionfees we have no long-lived assets outside the united states  industry and competitive overview  we operate in the subscription segment of the in-home entertainment video market in  we expanded our dvd-by-mail distribution model toinclude streaming content over the internet this hybrid distribution model expands the consumer appeal of the netflix subscription service beyond the traditional reach of the dvd rental segment and offers subscribers a uniquely compelling selectionof content both streaming and dvd for one low monthly price while the consumer appeal of this hybrid service has grown quickly the market for internet delivered video content is still in its formative stages and we expect competition to beintense  currently the market for internet delivered video consists of three market segments video-on-demandvod ad supported and subscription the vod segment includes competitors like amazon apple blockbuster cinemanow and microsoft the ad supported segment includes competitors like hulu and youtube currently netflix is the primaryprovider in the subscription segment but we expect direct and indirect competition to emerge and continue to grow as the consumer appeal for internet delivery of video continues to expand  the market for in-home entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneousrelationships with multiple in-home entertainment video providers and can   table of contentseasily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to cable rent a dvd from redbox or blockbuster buy a dvd from wal-mart or amazon download a movie fromapple itunes watch a tv show on hulucom and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at a relatively low cost dvds and internet delivery of content representonly two of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing entertainment video in addition the growth in adoption of dvd and internet delivery of content is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies  our principal competitors include   dvd rental outlets and kiosk services such as blockbuster movie gallery and redbox   video package providers with pay-per-view and vod content including cable providers such as time warner and comcast direct broadcast satelliteproviders such as directv and echostar and telecommunication providers such as att and verizon   online dvd subscription rental web sites such as blockbuster online   entertainment video retail stores such as best buy wal-mart and amazoncom and   internet movie and tv content providers such as apples itunes amazoncom hulucom and googles youtube  studio licensing and movie distribution  motion pictures including movies and tv episodes entertainment video are distributed broadly through a variety of channels including movie theaters airlines hotels and in-home in-homedistribution channels include dvd rental retail outlets and web sites internet delivery and cable satellite and telecommunication providers offering basic and premium tv pay-per-view and vod currently studios distribute movies approximatelythree to six months after theatrical release to the home video market three to seven months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and vod one year after theatrical release to premium tv and two to three years after theatrical release to basiccable and network tv internet delivered content is made available typically at the same time as pay-per-view or vod however some content such as tv episodes are often made available for internet viewing shortly after the original airing datethe major studios and tv networks have continued to experiment with shortened release windows and we anticipate that they will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional windows including releasing moviessimultaneously on dvd and vod  competitive strengths  we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths  iconic brand netflix has been highly rated in online retail customer satisfaction by independent surveys from nielsen online and in every one of the ten consecutive surveysconducted by foreseefgi research because of the high level of consumer satisfaction with netflix over  percent of surveyed subscribers say that they would recommend the netflix service to a friend we believe that these high levels of customersatisfaction and brand loyalty make it expensive and difficult for competitors to displace netflix as a subscription segment leader  personalized merchandising we utilize various tools including our proprietary recommendation technology to create a custom interface for each subscriber we believe that this customization enhances the userexperience by helping netflix subscribers discover great movies subscribers rate titles through our service and our recommendation technology compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base for eachsubscriber these comparisons are used to make predictions about specific titles the subscriber may enjoy these predictions along with other factors are used to help merchandise titles to   table of contentssubscribers we believe that our recommendation technology and our other merchandising practices allow us to create broad-based demand for our library and maximize utilization of our library bycreating demand for content we seek to cost-effectively balance subscriber demand between newer more expensive titles and older less expensive titles our ability to generate demand for these older or long-tail titles whilemaintaining high levels of customer satisfaction helps us manage and maintain our gross margin subscriber acquisition cost churn rate and lifetime subscriber profit to that end approximately  of the dvds shipped during  were titles withdvd release dates greater than  weeks  growing scale we have achieved a level of scale in ourbusiness that provides many operational and competitive advantages from an operational perspective for example we are able to cost effectively automate many of our shipping and receiving processes helping to drive down unit shipping costs whilealso providing a better more consistent experience to our subscribers such scale economies also have contributed over time to expanding operating margins which has made it possible for netflix to aggressively price its service offering at levelsdifficult for competition to meet  convenience selection and fast delivery subscribers canconveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue of titles on our web site or by selecting titles directly from select netflix ready devices we create a unique experience for subscribers by generating user interfaces on ourwebsite and netflix ready devices

entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels including movie theaters airlines hotels and in-home in-home distributionchannels include home video rental and retail outlets cable and satellite television pay-per-view video-on-demand or vod and broadcast television currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to sixmonths after theatrical release to the home video market four to seven months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and vod one year after theatrical release to premium television and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cableand network television however in what continues to be an emerging trend the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window we anticipate that the studios will continue totest a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional window including releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod but we believe that dvd and its high definition successors such as blu-ray will continue to receive a preferentialdistribution window in light of the large profits dvd generates for the studios  challenges faced by consumers in selecting in-homefilmed entertainment  the proliferation of new releases available for in-home filmed entertainment and the additional demand for backcatalog titles on dvd create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles  first despite the large number of available titleson dvd existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets stock a limited selection of titles frustrating consumer demand for more choice subscription channels pay-per-view and vod services continue to offer a relatively narrowselection of titles likewise traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalog titles we believe our selection of approximately  titles on dvd offers an attractivealternative to these traditional channels  second even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available they generallyhave limited means to effectively sort through the titles we believe our recommendation service and our web site features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences table of contentscompetitive strengths  we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths   comprehensive library of titles we have developed strategic relationships with top studios and distributors enabling us to establishand maintain a broad and deep selection of dvd titles since our service is available nationally we believe that we can economically acquire and provide

competitive and subject torapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to

11,2006-12-31T05:00:00Z,financialEntities/params;cik=1065280,"We are the largest online movie rental subscription service providing more than 6,300,000 subscribers access to a comprehensive library of more than 70,000 movie, television and other filmed entertainment titles on DVD. We offer a variety of subscription plans, starting at $4.99 a month. There are no due dates, no late fees and no shipping fees. Subscribers select titles at our Web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service, receive them on DVD by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the next available DVD in a subscriber’s queue. We also offer certain titles through our new instant-viewing feature.Our subscription service has grown rapidly since inception. This growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of DVDs as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online DVD rentals. We also believe our growth has been driven by our comprehensive selection of titles, consistently high levels of custo er satisfaction and our effective marketing programs. We expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online DVD rentals continues to grow, a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model. Our core strategy is to grow a large DVD subscription business and to expand into Internet-based movie delivery as that market develops. We believe that the DVD format, along with its successor formats of HD DVD and Blu-Ray, will continue to be the main vehicle for watching movies in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large DVD subscription business, we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to Internet-based movie delivery as it becomes a mainstream method for movie distribution. To this end, we introduced a new feature in January 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers. We expect to roll out this instant-viewing feature to all subscribers within six months from the date of launch, and we will continue to improve its quality, content and functionality. We intend to broaden the distribution capability of this service to multiple platforms over time. Our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandise our comprehensive library of DVDs. We believe that our recommendation technology, based on proprietary algorithms and the approximately 1.7 billion movie ratings we have collected from our subscribers, enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization. We continually invest in improvements to our service in an effort to deepen our subscriber relationships as well as to further distinguish our service from that of our competitors. We focus on improving our website experience and functionality and seek to create value-added features for our subscribers, such as our social networking feature, called Friends R and our queue management feature, called Profiles SM . In addition, we generate a small portion of our revenue from the sale of advertising. We promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs, including online promotions, television and radio advertising, package inserts, direct mail and other promotions with third parties. These programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period. At the end of the free trial period, subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers, unless they cancel their subscription. All paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance. We stock more than 70,000 DVD titles. We have established revenue sharing relationships with several studios and distributors. We also purchase titles directly from studios, distributors and independent producers. In addition, we have more than 1,000 titles available on our website for instant viewing. We also develop and acquire content through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Envelope Entertainment, LLC, which is dedicated to developing and acquiring original content productions. We ship and receive DVDs throughout the United States. We maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allow us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers. We are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs. Our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business, including our Web site interface, order processing, fulfillment operations and customer service. We believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements. We are organized in a single operating segment. All our revenues are generated in the United States, and we have no long-lived assets outside the United States. Substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees. Industry Overview Filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels. Out-of-home channels include movie theaters, airlines and hotels. In-home distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets, cable and satellite television, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, or VOD and broadcast television. Currently, studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market, seven to nine months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and VOD, one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks. However, in what continues to be an emerging trend, the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles, in particular the theatrical to home video window. We anticipate that the studios will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional window, including releasing movies simultaneously on DVD and VOD, but we believe that DVD, and its high definition successors HD-DVD and BluRay, will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits DVD generates for the studios. Challenges Faced by Consumers in Selecting In-Home Filmed Entertainment The proliferation of new releases available for in-home filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalog titles on DVD create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles. First, despite the large number of available titles on DVD, consumers lack a deep selection of titles from existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets. Subscription channels, pay-per-view and video-on-demand services continue to offer a narrow selection of titles. Likewise, traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalog titles. We believe our selection of over 70,000 titles on DVD offers an attractive alternative to these traditional channels. Second, even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available, they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles. We believe our recommendation service and our website features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences. We also recently launched our Previews feature, which allows subscribers to conveniently and efficiently browse through promotional trailers of movies they may find appealing and directly add them to their queue.Competitive Strengths We believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths: Comprehensive Library of Titles.     We have developed strategic relationships with top studios and distributors, enabling us to establish and maintain a broad and deep selection of DVD titles. Since our service is available nationally, we believe that we can economically acquire and provide subscribers a broader selection of DVD titles than video rental outlets, video retailers, subscription channels, pay-per-view and VOD services. To maximize our selection of DVD titles, we continuously add newly released DVD titles to our library. Our DVD library contains numerous copies of popular new releases, as well as many DVD titles that appeal to more select audiences. We currently offer more than 70,000 DVD titles and more than 1,000 titles available through our instant-viewing feature.Personalized Merchandising.     We utilize our proprietary recommendation service to create a custom interface for each subscriber to effectively merchandise our library. Subscribers rate titles on our Web site, and our recommendation service compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base. For each visitor, these comparisons are used to make predictions about specific titles the visitor may enjoy. These predictions are used to merchandise titles to visitors throughout the Web site. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 1.7 billion movie ratings in our database. We believe that our recommendation service allows us to create demand for our entire library and maximize utilization of each DVD. Scalable Business Model.     We believe that we have a scalable, low-cost business model designed to maximize our revenues and minimize our costs. As we continue to expand our subscriber base, we are able to leverage operational changes in a cost effective manner which further reduces our operating costs on a per subscriber basis. Such cost reductions include increased automation and vendor negotiating leverage. Subscribers’ prepaid monthly payments and the recurring nature of our subscription business provide working capital benefits and significant near-term revenue visibility. Our scalable infrastructure and online interface allow us to service our large and expanding subscriber base from a network of low-cost shipping centers. Convenience, Selection and Fast Delivery.     Subscribers can conveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue of titles on our Web site. We create a unique experience for subscribers because most pages on our Web site are tailored to individual selection and ratings history. Under our most popular service, subscribers can have up to three DVDs out at the same time with no due dates or late fees. Based on their queue, we send them available DVDs by U.S. mail that subscribers return to us in prepaid mailers. After receipt of returned DVDs, we mail subscribers the next available DVD in their queue of selected titles. We have over 70,000 DVD titles to choose from and our nationwide network of distribution centers allows us to offer fast delivery. In addition, in January of 2007, we introduced our instant-viewing feature which is being made available to subscribers in a phased roll-out. Growth Strategy Our strategy to provide a premier filmed entertainment subscription service to our large and growing subscriber base includes the following key elements: Providing Compelling Value for Subscribers.     We provide subscribers access to our comprehensive library of more than 70,000 DVD titles with no due dates, late fees or shipping charges for a fixed monthly fee. We merchandise titles in easy-to-recognize lists including new releases, by genre and other targeted categories. We also offer more than 1,000 titles through our instant-viewing feature. Our convenient, easy-to-use Web site allows subscribers to quickly select current titles, reserve upcoming releases and build an individual queue for future viewing using our proprietary personalization technology. We provide service features to our subscribers that, among other things, enable social networking and further individualization of the service through establishment of sub-account queues and recommendations. Our recommendation service provides subscribers with recommendations of titles from our library and our Previews feature allows subscribers to experience recommended titles by viewing promotional trailers in a simple, easy-to-use format. We quickly deliver DVDs to subscribers from our shipping centers located throughout the United States by U.S. mail and in January 2007, we introduced our instant-viewing feature which is being made available to subscribers in a phased roll-out. Utilizing Technology to Enhance Subscriber Experience and Operate Efficiently.     We utilize proprietary technology developed internally to manage the processing and distribution of DVDs from our shipping centers. Our software automates the process of tracking and routing DVDs to and from each of our shipping centers and allocates order responsibilities among them. We continuously monitor, test and seek to improve the efficiency of our distribution, processing and inventory management systems as our subscriber base and shipping volume grows. We operate a nationwide network of shipping centers and continue to develop and grow this network to meet the demands of our operations. Building Mutually Beneficial Relationships with Filmed Entertainment Providers.     We have invested substantial resources in establishing strong ties with various filmed entertainment providers. We maintain an office in Los Angeles that provides us access to the major studios. We acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases. We work with the content providers to determine which method of acquiring titles is the most beneficial for each party. Our growing subscriber base provides studios with an additional distribution outlet for popular movies and television series, as well as niche titles and programs. Our Web site—www.netflix.com we have applied substantial resources to plan, develop and maintain proprietary technology to implement the features of our Web site, such as subscription account signup and management, personalized movie merchandising, inventory optimization and customer support. We offer features such as our social networking feature, called Friends R and our queue management feature, called Profiles SM . In addition, we recently launched our Previews feature, allowing subscribers to browse promotional movie trailers as well as our instant-viewing feature that allows subscribers to instantly watch certain movies and television series on their personal computers. We also provide our subscribers with the ability to purchase certain previously viewed DVDs. Our software is written in a variety of computing languages and runs on industry standard platforms. Our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database. This technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to each subscriber. We believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service, each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history, inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber. Our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers. We use a real-time postal address validator to help our subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to promote speedy and accurate delivery. Subscribers pay for our service primarily by a credit or debit card. We utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment methods. Throughout our Web site, we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities, allowing us to continuously optimize our Web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers. We use random control testing extensively, including testing service levels, plans, promotions and pricing. Our Web site is run on hardware and software co-located at a service provider offering reliable network connections, power, air conditioning and other essential infrastructure. We manage our Web site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We utilize a variety of proprietary software and freely available and commercially supported tools, integrated in a system designed to rapidly and precisely diagnose and recover from failures. We conduct upgrades and installations of software in a manner designed to minimize disruptions to our subscribers. The terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse. Merchandising The key to our merchandising efforts is the personal recommendations generated by our recommendation service. All subscribers and site visitors are given many opportunities to rate titles and we have collected approximately 1.7 billion ratings. The ratings from our recommendation service determine which available titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order. In doing so, we help our subscribers quickly find titles they are more likely to enjoy. Ratings also determine which available titles are featured most prominently on our Web site to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity. Finally, data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists of similar titles as well as the promotional trailers they may see when engaged with our Previews feature. Subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our “Recommendations” link to find other titles they may enjoy. This has proven to be a powerful method for catalog browsing and expanding library utilization. We also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy. This information may include: factual data, including length, rating, cast and crew, special DVD features and screen formats. movie trailers and other editorial perspectives, including plot synopses and reviews written by our editors, third parties and by other Netflix subscribers; and data from our recommendation service, including personal rating, average rating and other similar titles the subscriber may enjoy. Marketing We have multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service. Online advertising is an important channel for acquiring new subscribers. We advertise our service online through paid search listings, banner ads, text on popular Web portals and other Web sites and permission based e-mails. In addition, we have an affiliate program whereby we make available Web-based banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a self-assisted basis from our Web site and place on their Web sites. We also advertise our service on various regional and national television and radio stations. We utilize direct mail and print advertising as well as promote our services in certain consumer package goods. We also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studio’s movies in Netflix promotional advertising. We believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising, our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs. Content Acquisition We acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases. Under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors, we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues for a defined period of time. After the revenue sharing period expires for a title, we generally have the option of returning the title to the studio, destroying the title or purchasing the title. The principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio. In addition to revenue sharing agreements, we also purchase titles from various studios, distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis. For titles delivered through our instant-viewing feature, we license content on a fixed fee or per-view basis from various studios and other content providers. Fulfillment Operations We currently stock more than 70,000 titles on more than 55 million DVDs. We have allocated substantial resources to developing, maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our Web site, transaction processing systems, fulfillment operations, inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers. We ship and receive DVDs from a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the United States. We believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the subscription experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our DVDs through the U.S. Postal Service. We currently do not ship on weekends or holidays. Customer Service We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with subscribers depends, in part, on the strength of our customer support and service operations. We engage in frequent communication with our subscribers in order to continually improve our Web site and our service. Our customer service center is open seven days a week. We utilize e-mail and phone service to communicate with subscribers. We focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and providing certain self-service features on our Web site, such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems. We continue to explore new avenues to deliver efficient problem resolution and feedback channels. Our customer service center is located in Hillsboro, Oregon. Competition The market for in-home filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. For example, consumers may subscribe to HBO, rent a DVD from Blockbuster, buy or download a DVD from Wal-Mart or Amazon and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in the same month. Video rental outlets and retailers with whom we compete include Blockbuster, Movie Gallery, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy. We believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection, convenience and price. We believe that our scalable business model, our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 70,000 DVD titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets and retailers. We also compete against other online DVD subscription services, such as Blockbuster Online, subscription entertainment services, such as HBO and Showtime, pay-per-view and VOD providers and cable and satellite providers. It remains possible that other potential online entrants will offer competing services, either directly or in conjunction with others. In late 2006, Blockbuster launched its integrated store-based and online program, Total Access, whereby Blockbuster online subscribers may return DVDs delivered to them from Blockbuster Online to Blockbuster stores in exchange for an in-store rental. This latest initiative by Blockbuster follows a similar initiative aimed at leveraging their store-based business with their online offering through the use of coupons for free in-store rentals for online subscribers. As of year end, Blockbuster has grown their on-line business to approximately 2 million subscribers. We have seen Blockbuster aggressively promote their Total Access program through in-store promotions and sign-ups as well as advertising on television and other mass-media channels. We believe we are able to provide greater satisfaction for consumers who subscribe to our service due to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental, the broad and deep selection of DVD titles we offer subscribers, our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history, personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences, the unique features we offer subscribers, such as our instant-viewing feature, Previews, Friends R and Profiles SM , as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select, receive and return DVDs. We continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business. VOD and downloading of movies over the Internet continues to receive considerable media attention. Apple’s video iPod, Amazon’s Unbox, Wal-Mart’s DVD download offerings and announcements from other companies ranging from Google and Yahoo! to Microsoft and Intel regarding their efforts in digital delivery of content fuels public interest in the future of video entertainment delivery. Progress in digital delivery, although slow and scattered, continues to be made. VOD, for example, is now widely available to digital cable subscribers in major metropolitan areas, such as New York, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Downloading of movies over the Internet to a personal computer is currently available from providers, such as iTunes, Vongo, Movielink and CinemaNow. To this end, we introduced a new feature in January 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers. We expect to roll out this instant-viewing feature to all subscribers within six months from the date of launch, and we will continue to improve its quality, content and functionality. We intend to broaden the distribution capability of this service to multiple platforms over time. While we anticipate that new devices and services for delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years, we believe that DVD, and its high definition successors, HD-DVD and BluRay, will continue to dominate the home entertainment experience in the near term. At some point in the future, digital delivery directly to the home will surpass DVD. Our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences and our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for DVD rentals positions us favorably to further develop our digital distribution offering as that market develops. The downloading market is segmented into rental of online delivered content, the download-to-own segment and the advertising-supported online delivery segment, and we believe we will lead the rental segment with our instant-viewing feature as it develops Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had 1,300 full-time employees. We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our fulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments. As of December 31, 2006, we had 646 temporary employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Intellectual Property We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We have filed patents in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., we were issued broad business method patents covering, among other things, our subscription rental service in 2003 and 2006, and we were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005. While our patents are an important element of our business, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or acombination of patents. We have a registered service mark for the Netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks. Our software, the content of our Web site and other material which we create is protected by copyright. We also protect certain details about our business methods, processes and strategies as trade secrets, and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. To date, we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and know-how to protect our intellectual property. It is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage. From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute.

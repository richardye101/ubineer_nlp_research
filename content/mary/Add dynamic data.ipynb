Our most popular subscription plan allows subscribers to have up to three titles out at the same time with no due dates, late fees or shipping charges for $17.99 per month. In addition, we offer a number of other subscription plans to accommodate a variety of movie watching preferences. Subscribers select titles at our Web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service, receive them on DVD by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a title has been returned, we mail the next available title in a subscriber’s queue. Our subscription service has grown rapidly since its launch in late 1999. This growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of DVDs as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online DVD rentals. We also believe our growth has been driven by our comprehensive selection of titles, consistently high levels of customer satisfaction and our effective marketing programs. We expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online DVD rentals continues to grow, a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model. Our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandize our comprehensive library of titles. We believe that our recommendation technology, based on proprietary algorithms and the approximately one billion movie ratings we have collected from our subscribers, enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization. We continually invest in improvements to our service in an effort to deepen our subscriber relationships as well as to further distinguish our service from that of our competitors. We focus on improving our website experience and functionality and seek to create value-added features for our subscribers, such as our social networking feature, called Friends SM and our queue management feature, called Profiles SM . In addition, we continue to focus on the new revenue initiatives launched in the second quarter of 2005: retail sales of previously-viewed DVDs and our Ad Sales program. We also continue to invest resources to develop solutions for downloading movies to consumers. Our core strategy has been and remains to grow a large DVD subscription business; however, as technology and infrastructure develop to allow effective and convenient delivery of movies over the Internet and when meaningful content becomes available, we intend to offer our subscribers the choice of receiving their movies on DVD or by downloading, whichever they prefer. We promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs, including online promotions, television and radio advertising, package inserts, direct mail and other promotions with third parties. These programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period of 14 days. At the end of the free trial period, subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers, unless they cancel their subscription. All paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance.We stock more than 55,000 DVD titles. We have established revenue sharing relationships with several studios and distributors. We also purchase titles directly from studios, distributors and independent producers.We ship and receive DVDs throughout the United States. We maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allow us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers.We are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs. Our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business, including our Web site interface, order processing, fulfillment operations, and customer service. We believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements.We are organized in a single operating segment. All our revenues are generated in the United States, and we have no long-lived assets outside the United States. Substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees. Industry Overview Filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels. Out-of-home channels include movie theaters, airlines, and hotels. In-home distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets, cable and satellite television, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, or VOD, and broadcast television. Currently, studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market, seven to nine months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and VOD, one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable, and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks. However, in what continues to be an emerging trend, the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles, in particular the theatrical to home video window. We anticipate that the studios will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional window, including releasing movies simultaneously on DVD and VOD, but we believe that DVD, and its high definition successors HD-DVD and BluRay, will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits DVD generates for the studios. The proliferation of new releases available for in-home filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalogue titles on DVD create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles. First, despite the large number of available titles, consumers lack a deep selection of titles from existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets. Subscription channels, such as HBO and Showtime, and pay-per-view services continue to offer a narrow selection of titles at specified times due to programming schedule constraints and technological issues relating to channel capacity. Traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalogue titles. We believe our selection of over 55,000 titles offers an attractive alternative to these traditional channels.Second, even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available, they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles. We believe our recommendation service and our website features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences.Competitive Strengths We believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths: Comprehensive Library of Titles.     We have developed strategic relationships with top studios and distributors, enabling us to establish and maintain a broad and deep selection of titles. Since our service is available nationally, we believe that we can economically acquire and provide subscribers a broader selection of titles than video rental outlets, video retailers, subscription channels, pay-per-view and VOD services. To maximize our selection of titles, we continuously add newly released titles to our library. Our library contains numerous copies of popular new releases, as well as many titles that appeal to more select audiences. We currently offer more than 55,000 titles. Personalized Merchandizing.     We utilize our proprietary recommendation service to create a custom interface for each subscriber to effectively merchandize our library. Subscribers rate titles on our Web site, and our recommendation service compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base. For each visitor, these comparisons are used to make predictions about specific titles the visitor may enjoy. These predictions are used to merchandize titles to visitors throughout the Web site. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately one billion movie ratings in our database. We believe that our recommendation service allows us to create demand for our entire library and maximize utilization of each title. Scalable Business Model.     We believe that we have a scalable, low-cost business model designed to maximize our revenues and minimize our costs. As we continue to expand our subscriber base, we are able to leverage operational changes in a cost effective manner which further reduces our operating costs on a per subscriber basis. Such cost reductions include increased automation and vendor negotiating leverage. Subscribers’ prepaid monthly payments and the recurring nature of our subscription business provide working capital benefits and significant near-term revenue visibility. Our scalable infrastructure and online interface eliminate the need for expensive retail outlets and allow us to service our large and expanding subscriber base from a network of low-cost shipping centers. We employ temporary, hourly and part-time workers to contain labor costs and provide maximum operating flexibility.Convenience, Selection and Fast Delivery.     Subscribers can conveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue of titles on our Web site. We create a unique experience for subscribers because most pages on our Web site are tailored to individual selection and ratings history. Under our most popular service, subscribers can have up to three DVDs out at the same time with no due dates or late fees. Based on their queue, we send them available DVDs by U.S. mail that are then returned to us in prepaid mailers. After receipt of returned DVDs, we mail subscribers the next available title in their queue of selected titles. We have over 55,000 titles to choose from and our nationwide network of distribution centers allows us to offer fast delivery. Growth Strategy Our strategy to provide a premier filmed entertainment subscription service to our large and growing subscriber base includes the following key elements: Providing Compelling Value for Subscribers.     We provide subscribers access to our comprehensive library of more than 55,000 titles with no due dates, late fees or shipping charges for a fixed monthly fee. We merchandize titles in easy-to-recognize lists including new releases, by genre and other targeted categories. Our convenient, easy-to-use Web site allows subscribers to quickly select current titles, reserve upcoming releases and build an individual queue for future viewing using our proprietary personalization technology. We provide service features to our subscribers that, among other things, enable social networking and further individualization of the service through establishment of sub-account queues and recommendations. Our recommendation service provides subscribers with recommendations of titles from our library. We quickly deliver titles to subscribers from our shipping centers located throughout the United States by U.S. mail.Utilizing Technology to Enhance Subscriber Experience and Operate Efficiently.     We utilize proprietary technology developed internally to manage the processing and distribution of DVDs from our shipping centers. Our software automates the process of tracking and routing titles to and from each of our shipping centers and allocates order responsibilities among them. We continuously monitor, test and seek to improve the efficiency of our distribution, processing and inventory management systems as our subscriber base and shipping volume grows. We operate a nationwide network of shipping centers. We anticipate opening additional shipping centers in 2006.Building Mutually Beneficial Relationships with Filmed Entertainment Providers.     We have invested substantial resources in establishing strong ties with various filmed entertainment providers. We maintain an office in Los Angeles that provides us access to the major studios. We have entered into a number of revenue sharing agreements with studios and we also purchase titles directly. We work with the content providers to determine which method of acquiring titles is the most beneficial for each party. Our growing subscriber base provides studios with an additional distribution outlet for popular movies and television series, as well as niche titles and programs.Our Web site—www.netflix.com We have applied substantial resources to plan, develop and maintain proprietary technology to implement the features of our Web site, such as subscription account signup and management, personalized movie merchandising, inventory optimization and customer support. We also launched new features such as our social networking feature, called Friends SM and our queue management feature, called Profiles SM . Our software is written in a variety of languages and runs on industry standard platforms. Our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database. This technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to each subscriber. We believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service, each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history, inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber. Our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers. We use a real-time postal address validator to help our subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to promote speedy and accurate delivery. Subscribers pay for our service primarily by a credit or debit card. We utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment methods. Throughout our Web site, we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities, allowing us to continuously optimize our Web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers. We use random control testing extensively, including testing service levels, plans, promotions and pricing. ur Web site is run on hardware and software co-located at a service provider offering reliable network connections, power, air conditioning and other essential infrastructure. We manage our Web site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We utilize a variety of proprietary software and freely available and commercially supported tools, integrated in a system designed to rapidly and precisely diagnose and recover from failures. We conduct upgrades and installations of software in a manner designed to minimize disruptions to our subscribers. The terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse. Merchandizing approximately one billion ratings. The ratings from our recommendation service determine which available titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order. In doing so, we help our subscribers quickly find titles they are more likely to enjoy. Ratings also determine which available titles are featured most prominently on our Web site to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity. Finally, data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists of similar titles. Subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our “Recommendations” link to find other titles they may enjoy. This has proven to be a powerful method for catalogue browsing and expanding library utilization. We also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy. This information may include:factual data, including length, rating, cast and crew, special DVD features and screen formats;editorial perspective, including plot synopses, movie trailers and reviews written by our editors, third parties and by other Netflix subscribers; and data from our recommendation service, including personal rating, average rating and other similar titles the subscriber may enjoy. Marketing We have multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service. Online advertising is an important channel for acquiring new subscribers. We advertise our service online through paid search listings, banner ads, text on popular Web portals and other Web sites, and permission based e-mails. In addition, we have an affiliate program whereby we make available Web-based banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a self-assisted basis from our Web site and place on their Web sites. We also advertise our service on various regional and national television and radio stations. We utilize direct mail and print advertising as well as promote our services in certain consumer package goods. We also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studio’s movies in Netflix promotional advertising. We believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising, our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs. Content Acquisition We acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases. Under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors, we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues for a defined period of time. After the revenue sharing period expires for a title, we generally have the option of returning the title to the studio, destroying the title or purchasing the title. The principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio. In addition to revenue sharing agreements, we also purchase titles from various studios, distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis. Fulfillment Operations We currently stock more than 55,000 titles on more than 25 million DVDs. We have allocated substantial resources to developing, maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our Web site, transaction processing systems, fulfillment operations, inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers. We ship and receive DVDs from a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the United States. We believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the subscription experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our DVDs through the U.S. Postal Service. We currently do not ship on weekends or holidays. Customer Service We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with subscribers depends, in part, on the strength of our customer support and service operations. We encourage and utilize frequent communication with and feedback from our subscribers in order to continually improve our Web site and our service. Our customer service center is open seven days a week. We utilize e-mail to correspond with subscribers. We also offer phone support for subscribers who prefer to talk directly with a customer service representative. We focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and automating certain self-service features on our Web site, such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems. Our customer service center is located in our Sunnyvale, California facility. Competition The market for in-home filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. For example, consumers may subscribe to HBO, rent a DVD from Blockbuster, buy a DVD from Wal-Mart and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in the same month. Video rental outlets and retailers with whom we compete include Blockbuster, Movie Gallery, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy. In particular, in 2004, Blockbuster launched on a nationwide basis its store-based subscription program. This program provides many of the benefits of our business model in a store-based retail environment. In addition, Blockbuster’s elimination of its traditional late fee policy has been adopted by all of its company-owned stores and many of its franchised stores. We believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection, convenience and price. We believe that our scalable business model, our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 55,000 titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets. We also compete against other online DVD subscription services, such as Blockbuster Online, subscription entertainment services, such as HBO and Showtime, pay-per-view and VOD providers, and cable and satellite providers. It remains possible that other potential online entrants will offer competing services, either directly or in conjunction with others, or that Blockbuster Online will gain more traction in its current business. We believe we are able to provide greater subscriber satisfaction due to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental, the broad and deep selection of titles we offer subscribers, our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history, personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences, the unique features we offer subscribers, such as Friends SM and Profiles SM as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select, receive and return titles. We continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business. VOD and downloading of movies over the Internet continues to receive considerable media attention. In particular, the recent launch of Apple’s video iPod and announcements from companies ranging from Google and Yahoo to Microsoft and Intel regarding their efforts in digital delivery of content fuels public interest in the future of video entertainment delivery. Progress in digital delivery, although slow and scattered, continues to be made. VOD, for example, is now widely available to digital cable subscribers in major metropolitan areas, such as New York, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Downloading of movies over the Internet to a personal computer is currently available from providers, such as Movielink and CinemaNow. We anticipate that new devices and services for delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years but believe that DVD, and its high definition successors, HD-DVD and BluRay, will continue to dominate the home entertainment experience in the near term. At some point in the future, digital delivery directly to the home will surpass DVD and we believe that our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for DVD rentals and our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences positions us favorably to provide digital distribution of filmed entertainment as that market develops. Employees As of December 31, 2005, we had 985 full-time employees. We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our fulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments. As of December 31, 2005, we had 445 temporary employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Intellectual Property We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We have filed patents in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., we were issued a broad business method patent covering, among other things, our subscription rental service in 2003, and we were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005. While our patents are an important element of our business, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a combination of patents. We have a registered service mark for the Netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks. Our software, the content of our Web site and other material which we create is protected by copyright. We also protect certain details about our business methods, processes, and strategies as trade secrets, and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. To date, we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and know-how to protect our intellectual property. It is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage. From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute.

Our most popular subscription plan allows subscribers to have up to three titles out at the same time with no due dates, late fees or shipping charges for $17.99 per month. In addition, we offer a number of other subscription plans to accommodate a variety of movie watching preferences. Subscribers select titles at our Web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service, receive them on DVD by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a title has been returned, we mail the next available title in a subscriber’s queue. Our subscription service has grown rapidly since its launch in late 1999. This growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of DVDs as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online DVD rentals. We also believe our growth has been driven by our comprehensive selection of titles, consistently high levels of customer satisfaction and our effective marketing programs. We expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online DVD rentals continues to grow, a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model. Our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandize our comprehensive library of titles. We believe that our recommendation technology, based on proprietary algorithms and the approximately one billion movie ratings we have collected from our subscribers, enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization. We continually invest in improvements to our service in an effort to deepen our subscriber relationships as well as to further distinguish our service from that of our competitors. We focus on improving our website experience and functionality and seek to create value-added features for our subscribers, such as our social networking feature, called Friends SM and our queue management feature, called Profiles SM . In addition, we continue to focus on the new revenue initiatives launched in the second quarter of 2005: retail sales of previously-viewed DVDs and our Ad Sales program. We also continue to invest resources to develop solutions for downloading movies to consumers. Our core strategy has been and remains to grow a large DVD subscription business; however, as technology and infrastructure develop to allow effective and convenient delivery of movies over the Internet and when meaningful content becomes available, we intend to offer our subscribers the choice of receiving their movies on DVD or by downloading, whichever they prefer. We promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs, including online promotions, television and radio advertising, package inserts, direct mail and other promotions with third parties. These programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period of 14 days. At the end of the free trial period, subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers, unless they cancel their subscription. All paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance.We stock more than 55,000 DVD titles. We have established revenue sharing relationships with several studios and distributors. We also purchase titles directly from studios, distributors and independent producers.We ship and receive DVDs throughout the United States. We maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allow us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers.We are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs. Our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business, including our Web site interface, order processing, fulfillment operations, and customer service. We believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements.We are organized in a single operating segment. All our revenues are generated in the United States, and we have no long-lived assets outside the United States. Substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees. Industry Overview Filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels. Out-of-home channels include movie theaters, airlines, and hotels. In-home distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets, cable and satellite television, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, or VOD, and broadcast television. Currently, studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market, seven to nine months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and VOD, one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable, and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks. However, in what continues to be an emerging trend, the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles, in particular the theatrical to home video window. We anticipate that the studios will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional window, including releasing movies simultaneously on DVD and VOD, but we believe that DVD, and its high definition successors HD-DVD and BluRay, will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits DVD generates for the studios. The proliferation of new releases available for in-home filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalogue titles on DVD create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles. First, despite the large number of available titles, consumers lack a deep selection of titles from existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets. Subscription channels, such as HBO and Showtime, and pay-per-view services continue to offer a narrow selection of titles at specified times due to programming schedule constraints and technological issues relating to channel capacity. Traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalogue titles. We believe our selection of over 55,000 titles offers an attractive alternative to these traditional channels.Second, even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available, they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles. We believe our recommendation service and our website features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences.Competitive Strengths We believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths: Comprehensive Library of Titles.     We have developed strategic relationships with top studios and distributors, enabling us to establish and maintain a broad and deep selection of titles. Since our service is available nationally, we believe that we can economically acquire and provide subscribers a broader selection of titles than video rental outlets, video retailers, subscription channels, pay-per-view and VOD services. To maximize our selection of titles, we continuously add newly released titles to our library. Our library contains numerous copies of popular new releases, as well as many titles that appeal to more select audiences. We currently offer more than 55,000 titles. Personalized Merchandizing.     We utilize our proprietary recommendation service to create a custom interface for each subscriber to effectively merchandize our library. Subscribers rate titles on our Web site, and our recommendation service compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base. For each visitor, these comparisons are used to make predictions about specific titles the visitor may enjoy. These predictions are used to merchandize titles to visitors throughout the Web site. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately one billion movie ratings in our database. We believe that our recommendation service allows us to create demand for our entire library and maximize utilization of each title. Scalable Business Model.     We believe that we have a scalable, low-cost business model designed to maximize our revenues and minimize our costs. As we continue to expand our subscriber base, we are able to leverage operational changes in a cost effective manner which further reduces our operating costs on a per subscriber basis. Such cost reductions include increased automation and vendor negotiating leverage. Subscribers’ prepaid monthly payments and the recurring nature of our subscription business provide working capital benefits and significant near-term revenue visibility. Our scalable infrastructure and online interface eliminate the need for expensive retail outlets and allow us to service our large and expanding subscriber base from a network of low-cost shipping centers. We employ temporary, hourly and part-time workers to contain labor costs and provide maximum operating flexibility.Convenience, Selection and Fast Delivery.     Subscribers can conveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue of titles on our Web site. We create a unique experience for subscribers because most pages on our Web site are tailored to individual selection and ratings history. Under our most popular service, subscribers can have up to three DVDs out at the same time with no due dates or late fees. Based on their queue, we send them available DVDs by U.S. mail that are then returned to us in prepaid mailers. After receipt of returned DVDs, we mail subscribers the next available title in their queue of selected titles. We have over 55,000 titles to choose from and our nationwide network of distribution centers allows us to offer fast delivery. Growth Strategy Our strategy to provide a premier filmed entertainment subscription service to our large and growing subscriber base includes the following key elements: Providing Compelling Value for Subscribers.     We provide subscribers access to our comprehensive library of more than 55,000 titles with no due dates, late fees or shipping charges for a fixed monthly fee. We merchandize titles in easy-to-recognize lists including new releases, by genre and other targeted categories. Our convenient, easy-to-use Web site allows subscribers to quickly select current titles, reserve upcoming releases and build an individual queue for future viewing using our proprietary personalization technology. We provide service features to our subscribers that, among other things, enable social networking and further individualization of the service through establishment of sub-account queues and recommendations. Our recommendation service provides subscribers with recommendations of titles from our library. We quickly deliver titles to subscribers from our shipping centers located throughout the United States by U.S. mail.Utilizing Technology to Enhance Subscriber Experience and Operate Efficiently.     We utilize proprietary technology developed internally to manage the processing and distribution of DVDs from our shipping centers. Our software automates the process of tracking and routing titles to and from each of our shipping centers and allocates order responsibilities among them. We continuously monitor, test and seek to improve the efficiency of our distribution, processing and inventory management systems as our subscriber base and shipping volume grows. We operate a nationwide network of shipping centers. We anticipate opening additional shipping centers in 2006.Building Mutually Beneficial Relationships with Filmed Entertainment Providers.     We have invested substantial resources in establishing strong ties with various filmed entertainment providers. We maintain an office in Los Angeles that provides us access to the major studios. We have entered into a number of revenue sharing agreements with studios and we also purchase titles directly. We work with the content providers to determine which method of acquiring titles is the most beneficial for each party. Our growing subscriber base provides studios with an additional distribution outlet for popular movies and television series, as well as niche titles and programs.Our Web site—www.netflix.com We have applied substantial resources to plan, develop and maintain proprietary technology to implement the features of our Web site, such as subscription account signup and management, personalized movie merchandising, inventory optimization and customer support. We also launched new features such as our social networking feature, called Friends SM and our queue management feature, called Profiles SM . Our software is written in a variety of languages and runs on industry standard platforms. Our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database. This technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to each subscriber. We believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service, each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history, inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber. Our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers. We use a real-time postal address validator to help our subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to promote speedy and accurate delivery. Subscribers pay for our service primarily by a credit or debit card. We utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment methods. Throughout our Web site, we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities, allowing us to continuously optimize our Web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers. We use random control testing extensively, including testing service levels, plans, promotions and pricing. ur Web site is run on hardware and software co-located at a service provider offering reliable network connections, power, air conditioning and other essential infrastructure. We manage our Web site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We utilize a variety of proprietary software and freely available and commercially supported tools, integrated in a system designed to rapidly and precisely diagnose and recover from failures. We conduct upgrades and installations of software in a manner designed to minimize disruptions to our subscribers. The terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse. Merchandizing approximately one billion ratings. The ratings from our recommendation service determine which available titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order. In doing so, we help our subscribers quickly find titles they are more likely to enjoy. Ratings also determine which available titles are featured most prominently on our Web site to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity. Finally, data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists of similar titles. Subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our “Recommendations” link to find other titles they may enjoy. This has proven to be a powerful method for catalogue browsing and expanding library utilization. We also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy. This information may include:factual data, including length, rating, cast and crew, special DVD features and screen formats;editorial perspective, including plot synopses, movie trailers and reviews written by our editors, third parties and by other Netflix subscribers; and data from our recommendation service, including personal rating, average rating and other similar titles the subscriber may enjoy. Marketing We have multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service. Online advertising is an important channel for acquiring new subscribers. We advertise our service online through paid search listings, banner ads, text on popular Web portals and other Web sites, and permission based e-mails. In addition, we have an affiliate program whereby we make available Web-based banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a self-assisted basis from our Web site and place on their Web sites. We also advertise our service on various regional and national television and radio stations. We utilize direct mail and print advertising as well as promote our services in certain consumer package goods. We also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studio’s movies in Netflix promotional advertising. We believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising, our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs. Content Acquisition We acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases. Under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors, we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues for a defined period of time. After the revenue sharing period expires for a title, we generally have the option of returning the title to the studio, destroying the title or purchasing the title. The principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio. In addition to revenue sharing agreements, we also purchase titles from various studios, distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis. Fulfillment Operations We currently stock more than 55,000 titles on more than 25 million DVDs. We have allocated substantial resources to developing, maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our Web site, transaction processing systems, fulfillment operations, inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers. We ship and receive DVDs from a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the United States. We believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the subscription experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our DVDs through the U.S. Postal Service. We currently do not ship on weekends or holidays. Customer Service We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with subscribers depends, in part, on the strength of our customer support and service operations. We encourage and utilize frequent communication with and feedback from our subscribers in order to continually improve our Web site and our service. Our customer service center is open seven days a week. We utilize e-mail to correspond with subscribers. We also offer phone support for subscribers who prefer to talk directly with a customer service representative. We focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and automating certain self-service features on our Web site, such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems. Our customer service center is located in our Sunnyvale, California facility. Competition The market for in-home filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. For example, consumers may subscribe to HBO, rent a DVD from Blockbuster, buy a DVD from Wal-Mart and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in the same month. Video rental outlets and retailers with whom we compete include Blockbuster, Movie Gallery, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy. In particular, in 2004, Blockbuster launched on a nationwide basis its store-based subscription program. This program provides many of the benefits of our business model in a store-based retail environment. In addition, Blockbuster’s elimination of its traditional late fee policy has been adopted by all of its company-owned stores and many of its franchised stores. We believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection, convenience and price. We believe that our scalable business model, our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 55,000 titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets. We also compete against other online DVD subscription services, such as Blockbuster Online, subscription entertainment services, such as HBO and Showtime, pay-per-view and VOD providers, and cable and satellite providers. It remains possible that other potential online entrants will offer competing services, either directly or in conjunction with others, or that Blockbuster Online will gain more traction in its current business. We believe we are able to provide greater subscriber satisfaction due to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental, the broad and deep selection of titles we offer subscribers, our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history, personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences, the unique features we offer subscribers, such as Friends SM and Profiles SM as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select, receive and return titles. We continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business. VOD and downloading of movies over the Internet continues to receive considerable media attention. In particular, the recent launch of Apple’s video iPod and announcements from companies ranging from Google and Yahoo to Microsoft and Intel regarding their efforts in digital delivery of content fuels public interest in the future of video entertainment delivery. Progress in digital delivery, although slow and scattered, continues to be made. VOD, for example, is now widely available to digital cable subscribers in major metropolitan areas, such as New York, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Downloading of movies over the Internet to a personal computer is currently available from providers, such as Movielink and CinemaNow. We anticipate that new devices and services for delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years but believe that DVD, and its high definition successors, HD-DVD and BluRay, will continue to dominate the home entertainment experience in the near term. At some point in the future, digital delivery directly to the home will surpass DVD and we believe that our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for DVD rentals and our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences positions us favorably to provide digital distribution of filmed entertainment as that market develops. Employees As of December 31, 2005, we had 985 full-time employees. We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our fulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments. As of December 31, 2005, we had 445 temporary employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Intellectual Property We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We have filed patents in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., we were issued a broad business method patent covering, among other things, our subscription rental service in 2003, and we were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005. While our patents are an important element of our business, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a combination of patents. We have a registered service mark for the Netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks. Our software, the content of our Web site and other material which we create is protected by copyright. We also protect certain details about our business methods, processes, and strategies as trade secrets, and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. To date, we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and know-how to protect our intellectual property. It is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage. From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute.

We believe that the DVD format, along with its successor formats of HD DVD and Blu-Ray, will continue to be the main vehicle for watching movies in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large DVD subscription business, we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to Internet-based movie delivery as it becomes a mainstream method for movie distribution. To this end, we introduced a new feature in January 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 1.7 billion movie ratings in our database. We believe that our recommendation service allows us to create demand for our entire library and maximize utilization of each DVD. Scalable Business Model.     We believe that we have a scalable, low-cost business model designed to maximize our revenues and minimize our costs. As we continue to expand our subscriber base, we are able to leverage operational changes in a cost effective manner which further reduces our operating costs on a per subscriber basis. Such cost reductions include increased automation and vendor negotiating leverage. Subscribers’ prepaid monthly payments and the recurring nature of our subscription business provide working capital benefits and significant near-term revenue visibility. Our scalable infrastructure and online interface allow us to service our large and expanding subscriber base from a network of low-cost shipping centers. Convenience, Selection and Fast Delivery.     Subscribers can conveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue of titles on our Web site. We create a unique experience for subscribers because most pages on our Web site are tailored to individual selection and ratings history. Under our most popular service, subscribers can have up to three DVDs out at the same time with no due dates or late fees. Based on their queue, we send them available DVDs by U.S. mail that subscribers return to us in prepaid mailers. After receipt of returned DVDs, we mail subscribers the next available DVD in their queue of selected titles. We have over 70,000 DVD titles to choose from and our nationwide network of distribution centers allows us to offer fast delivery. In addition, in January of 2007, we introduced our instant-viewing feature which is being made available to subscribers in a phased roll-out. Growth Strategy Our strategy to provide a premier filmed entertainment subscription service to our large and growing subscriber base includes the following key elements: Providing Compelling Value for Subscribers.     We provide subscribers access to our comprehensive library of more than 70,000 DVD titles with no due dates, late fees or shipping charges for a fixed monthly fee. We merchandise titles in easy-to-recognize lists including new releases, by genre and other targeted categories. We also offer more than 1,000 titles through our instant-viewing feature. Our convenient, easy-to-use Web site allows subscribers to quickly select current titles, reserve upcoming releases and build an individual queue for future viewing using our proprietary personalization technology. We provide service features to our subscribers that, among other things, enable social networking and further individualization of the service through establishment of sub-account queues and recommendations. Our recommendation service provides subscribers with recommendations of titles from our library and our Previews feature allows subscribers to experience recommended titles by viewing promotional trailers in a simple, easy-to-use format. We quickly deliver DVDs to subscribers from our shipping centers located throughout the United States by U.S. mail and in January 2007, we introduced our instant-viewing feature which is being made available to subscribers in a phased roll-out. Utilizing Technology to Enhance Subscriber Experience and Operate Efficiently.     We utilize proprietary technology developed internally to manage the processing and distribution of DVDs from our shipping centers. Our software automates the process of tracking and routing DVDs to and from each of our shipping centers and allocates order responsibilities among them. We continuously monitor, test and seek to improve the efficiency of our distribution, processing and inventory management systems as our subscriber base and shipping volume grows. We operate a nationwide network of shipping centers and continue to develop and grow this network to meet the demands of our operations. Building Mutually Beneficial Relationships with Filmed Entertainment Providers.     We have invested substantial resources in establishing strong ties with various filmed entertainment providers. We maintain an office in Los Angeles that provides us access to the major studios. We acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases. We work with the content providers to determine which method of acquiring titles is the most beneficial for each party. Our growing subscriber base provides studios with an additional distribution outlet for popular movies and television series, as well as niche titles and programs. Our Web site—www.netflix.com we have applied substantial resources to plan, develop and maintain proprietary technology to implement the features of our Web site, such as subscription account signup and management, personalized movie merchandising, inventory optimization and customer support. We offer features such as our social networking feature, called Friends R and our queue management feature, called Profiles SM . In addition, we recently launched our Previews feature, allowing subscribers to browse promotional movie trailers as well as our instant-viewing feature that allows subscribers to instantly watch certain movies and television series on their personal computers. We also provide our subscribers with the ability to purchase certain previously viewed DVDs. Our software is written in a variety of computing languages and runs on industry standard platforms. Our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database. This technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to each subscriber. We believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service, each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history, inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber. Our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers. We use a real-time postal address validator to help our subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to promote speedy and accurate delivery. Subscribers pay for our service primarily by a credit or debit card. We utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment methods. Throughout our Web site, we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities, allowing us to continuously optimize our Web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers. We use random control testing extensively, including testing service levels, plans, promotions and pricing. Our Web site is run on hardware and software co-located at a service provider offering reliable network connections, power, air conditioning and other essential infrastructure. We manage our Web site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We utilize a variety of proprietary software and freely available and commercially supported tools, integrated in a system designed to rapidly and precisely diagnose and recover from failures. We conduct upgrades and installations of software in a manner designed to minimize disruptions to our subscribers. The terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse. Merchandising The key to our merchandising efforts is the personal recommendations generated by our recommendation service. All subscribers and site visitors are given many opportunities to rate titles and we have collected approximately 1.7 billion ratings. The ratings from our recommendation service determine which available titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order. In doing so, we help our subscribers quickly find titles they are more likely to enjoy. Ratings also determine which available titles are featured most prominently on our Web site to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity. Finally, data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists of similar titles as well as the promotional trailers they may see when engaged with our Previews feature. Subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our “Recommendations” link to find other titles they may enjoy. This has proven to be a powerful method for catalog browsing and expanding library utilization. We also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy. This information may include: factual data, including length, rating, cast and crew, special DVD features and screen formats. movie trailers and other editorial perspectives, including plot synopses and reviews written by our editors, third parties and by other Netflix subscribers; and data from our recommendation service, including personal rating, average rating and other similar titles the subscriber may enjoy. Marketing We have multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service. Online advertising is an important channel for acquiring new subscribers. We advertise our service online through paid search listings, banner ads, text on popular Web portals and other Web sites and permission based e-mails. In addition, we have an affiliate program whereby we make available Web-based banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a self-assisted basis from our Web site and place on their Web sites. We also advertise our service on various regional and national television and radio stations. We utilize direct mail and print advertising as well as promote our services in certain consumer package goods. We also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studio’s movies in Netflix promotional advertising. We believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of word-of-mouth advertising, our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs. Content Acquisition We acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases. Under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors, we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues for a defined period of time. After the revenue sharing period expires for a title, we generally have the option of returning the title to the studio, destroying the title or purchasing the title. The principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio. In addition to revenue sharing agreements, we also purchase titles from various studios, distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis. For titles delivered through our instant-viewing feature, we license content on a fixed fee or per-view basis from various studios and other content providers. Fulfillment Operations We currently stock more than 70,000 titles on more than 55 million DVDs. We have allocated substantial resources to developing, maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our Web site, transaction processing systems, fulfillment operations, inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers. We ship and receive DVDs from a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the United States. We believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the subscription experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our DVDs through the U.S. Postal Service. We currently do not ship on weekends or holidays. Customer Service We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with subscribers depends, in part, on the strength of our customer support and service operations. We engage in frequent communication with our subscribers in order to continually improve our Web site and our service. Our customer service center is open seven days a week. We utilize e-mail and phone service to communicate with subscribers. We focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and providing certain self-service features on our Web site, such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems. We continue to explore new avenues to deliver efficient problem resolution and feedback channels. Our customer service center is located in Hillsboro, Oregon. Competition The market for in-home filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. For example, consumers may subscribe to HBO, rent a DVD from Blockbuster, buy or download a DVD from Wal-Mart or Amazon and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in the same month. Video rental outlets and retailers with whom we compete include Blockbuster, Movie Gallery, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy. We believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection, convenience and price. We believe that our scalable business model, our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 70,000 DVD titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets and retailers. We also compete against other online DVD subscription services, such as Blockbuster Online, subscription entertainment services, such as HBO and Showtime, pay-per-view and VOD providers and cable and satellite providers. It remains possible that other potential online entrants will offer competing services, either directly or in conjunction with others. In late 2006, Blockbuster launched its integrated store-based and online program, Total Access, whereby Blockbuster online subscribers may return DVDs delivered to them from Blockbuster Online to Blockbuster stores in exchange for an in-store rental. This latest initiative by Blockbuster follows a similar initiative aimed at leveraging their store-based business with their online offering through the use of coupons for free in-store rentals for online subscribers. As of year end, Blockbuster has grown their on-line business to approximately 2 million subscribers. We have seen Blockbuster aggressively promote their Total Access program through in-store promotions and sign-ups as well as advertising on television and other mass-media channels. We believe we are able to provide greater satisfaction for consumers who subscribe to our service due to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental, the broad and deep selection of DVD titles we offer subscribers, our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history, personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences, the unique features we offer subscribers, such as our instant-viewing feature, Previews, Friends R and Profiles SM , as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select, receive and return DVDs. We continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business. VOD and downloading of movies over the Internet continues to receive considerable media attention. Apple’s video iPod, Amazon’s Unbox, Wal-Mart’s DVD download offerings and announcements from other companies ranging from Google and Yahoo! to Microsoft and Intel regarding their efforts in digital delivery of content fuels public interest in the future of video entertainment delivery. Progress in digital delivery, although slow and scattered, continues to be made. VOD, for example, is now widely available to digital cable subscribers in major metropolitan areas, such as New York, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Downloading of movies over the Internet to a personal computer is currently available from providers, such as iTunes, Vongo, Movielink and CinemaNow. To this end, we introduced a new feature in January 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers. We expect to roll out this instant-viewing feature to all subscribers within six months from the date of launch, and we will continue to improve its quality, content and functionality. We intend to broaden the distribution capability of this service to multiple platforms over time. While we anticipate that new devices and services for delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years, we believe that DVD, and its high definition successors, HD-DVD and BluRay, will continue to dominate the home entertainment experience in the near term. At some point in the future, digital delivery directly to the home will surpass DVD. Our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences and our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for DVD rentals positions us favorably to further develop our digital distribution offering as that market develops. The downloading market is segmented into rental of online delivered content, the download-to-own segment and the advertising-supported online delivery segment, and we believe we will lead the rental segment with our instant-viewing feature as it develops Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had 1,300 full-time employees. We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our fulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments. As of December 31, 2006, we had 646 temporary employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Intellectual Property We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We have filed patents in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., we were issued broad business method patents covering, among other things, our subscription rental service in 2003 and 2006, and we were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005. While our patents are an important element of our business, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or acombination of patents. We have a registered service mark for the Netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks. Our software, the content of our Web site and other material which we create is protected by copyright. We also protect certain details about our business methods, processes and strategies as trade secrets, and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. To date, we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and know-how to protect our intellectual property. It is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage. From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute.

We offer a variety of subscription plans, starting at $4.99 a month. There are no due dates, no late fees and no shipping fees. Subscribers select titles at our Web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service, receive them on DVD by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the next available DVD in a subscriber’s queue. We also offer certain titles through our new instant-viewing feature.Our subscription service has grown rapidly since inception. This growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of DVDs as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online DVD rentals. We also believe our growth has been driven by our comprehensive selection of titles, consistently high levels of custo er satisfaction and our effective marketing programs. We expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online DVD rentals continues to grow, a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model. Our core strategy is to grow a large DVD subscription business and to expand into Internet-based movie delivery as that market develops. We believe that the DVD format, along with its successor formats of HD DVD and Blu-Ray, will continue to be the main vehicle for watching movies in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large DVD subscription business, we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to Internet-based movie delivery as it becomes a mainstream method for movie distribution. To this end, we introduced a new feature in January 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers. We expect to roll out this instant-viewing feature to all subscribers within six months from the date of launch, and we will continue to improve its quality, content and functionality. We intend to broaden the distribution capability of this service to multiple platforms over time. Our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandise our comprehensive library of DVDs. We believe that our recommendation technology, based on proprietary algorithms and the approximately 1.7 billion movie ratings we have collected from our subscribers, enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization. We continually invest in improvements to our service in an effort to deepen our subscriber relationships as well as to further distinguish our service from that of our competitors. We focus on improving our website experience and functionality and seek to create value-added features for our subscribers, such as our social networking feature, called Friends R and our queue management feature, called Profiles SM . In addition, we generate a small portion of our revenue from the sale of advertising. We promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs, including online promotions, television and radio advertising, package inserts, direct mail and other promotions with third parties. These programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period. At the end of the free trial period, subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers, unless they cancel their subscription. All paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance. We stock more than 70,000 DVD titles. We have established revenue sharing relationships with several studios and distributors. We also purchase titles directly from studios, distributors and independent producers. In addition, we have more than 1,000 titles available on our website for instant viewing. We also develop and acquire content through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Envelope Entertainment, LLC, which is dedicated to developing and acquiring original content productions. We ship and receive DVDs throughout the United States. We maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allow us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers. We are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs. Our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business, including our Web site interface, order processing, fulfillment operations and customer service. We believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements. We are organized in a single operating segment. All our revenues are generated in the United States, and we have no long-lived assets outside the United States. Substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees. Industry Overview Filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels. Out-of-home channels include movie theaters, airlines and hotels. In-home distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets, cable and satellite television, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, or VOD and broadcast television. Currently, studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market, seven to nine months after theatrical release to pay-per-view and VOD, one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks. However, in what continues to be an emerging trend, the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles, in particular the theatrical to home video window. We anticipate that the studios will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional window, including releasing movies simultaneously on DVD and VOD, but we believe that DVD, and its high definition successors HD-DVD and BluRay, will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits DVD generates for the studios. Challenges Faced by Consumers in Selecting In-Home Filmed Entertainment The proliferation of new releases available for in-home filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalog titles on DVD create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles. First, despite the large number of available titles on DVD, consumers lack a deep selection of titles from existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets. Subscription channels, pay-per-view and video-on-demand services continue to offer a narrow selection of titles. Likewise, traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalog titles. We believe our selection of over 70,000 titles on DVD offers an attractive alternative to these traditional channels. Second, even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available, they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles. We believe our recommendation service and our website features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences. We also recently launched our Previews feature, which allows subscribers to conveniently and efficiently browse through promotional trailers of movies they may find appealing and directly add them to their queue.Competitive Strengths We believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths: Comprehensive Library of Titles.     We have developed strategic relationships with top studios and distributors, enabling us to establish and maintain a broad and deep selection of DVD titles. Since our service is available nationally, we believe that we can economically acquire and provide subscribers a broader selection of DVD titles than video rental outlets, video retailers, subscription channels, pay-per-view and VOD services. To maximize our selection of DVD titles, we continuously add newly released DVD titles to our library. Our DVD library contains numerous copies of popular new releases, as well as many DVD titles that appeal to more select audiences. We currently offer more than 70,000 DVD titles and more than 1,000 titles available through our instant-viewing feature.Personalized Merchandising.     We utilize our proprietary recommendation service to create a custom interface for each subscriber to effectively merchandise our library. Subscribers rate titles on our Web site, and our recommendation service compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base. For each visitor, these comparisons are used to make predictions about specific titles the visitor may enjoy. These predictions are used to merchandise titles to visitors throughout the Web site. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 1.7 billion movie ratings in our database. We believe that our recommendation service allows us to create demand for our entire library and maximize utilization of each DVD. Scalable Business Model.     We believe that we have a scalable, low-cost business model designed to maximize our revenues and minimize our costs. As we continue to expand our subscriber base, we are able to leverage operational changes in a cost effective manner which further reduces our operating costs on a per subscriber basis. Such cost reductions include increased automation and vendor negotiating leverage. Subscribers’ prepaid monthly payments and the recurring nature of our subscription business provide working capital benefits and significant near-term revenue visibility. Our scalable infrastructure and online interface allow us to service our large and expanding subscriber base from a network of low-cost shipping centers. Convenience, Selection and Fast Delivery.     Subscribers can conveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue of titles on our Web site. We create a unique experience for subscribers because most pages on our Web site are tailored to individual selection and ratings history. Under our most popular service, subscribers can have up to three DVDs out at the same time with no due dates or late fees.

After receipt of returned DVDs, we mail subscribers the next available DVD in their queue of selected titles. We have over 70,000 DVD titles to choose from and our nationwide network of distribution centers allows us to offer fast delivery.

We advertise our service online through paid search listings, banner ads, text on popular Web portals and other Web sites and permission based e-mails.

Customer Service We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with subscribers depends, in part, on the strength of our customer support and service operations. We engage in frequent communication with our subscribers in order to continually improve our Web site and our service. Our customer service center is open seven days a week. We utilize e-mail and phone service to communicate with subscribers. We focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and providing certain self-service features on our Web site, such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems. We continue to explore new avenues to deliver efficient problem resolution and feedback channels. Our customer service center is located in Hillsboro, Oregon. Competition The market for in-home filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. For example, consumers may subscribe to HBO, rent a DVD from Blockbuster, buy or download a DVD from Wal-Mart or Amazon and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in the same month. Video rental outlets and retailers with whom we compete include Blockbuster, Movie Gallery, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy. We believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection, convenience and price. We believe that our scalable business model, our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 70,000 DVD titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets and retailers. We also compete against other online DVD subscription services, such as Blockbuster Online, subscription entertainment services, such as HBO and Showtime, pay-per-view and VOD providers and cable and satellite providers. It remains possible that other potential online entrants will offer competing services, either directly or in conjunction with others. In late 2006, Blockbuster launched its integrated store-based and online program, Total Access, whereby Blockbuster online subscribers may return DVDs delivered to them from Blockbuster Online to Blockbuster stores in exchange for an in-store rental. This latest initiative by Blockbuster follows a similar initiative aimed at leveraging their store-based business with their online offering through the use of coupons for free in-store rentals for online subscribers. As of year end, Blockbuster has grown their on-line business to approximately 2 million subscribers. We have seen Blockbuster aggressively promote their Total Access program through in-store promotions and sign-ups as well as advertising on television and other mass-media channels. We believe we are able to provide greater satisfaction for consumers who subscribe to our service due to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental, the broad and deep selection of DVD titles we offer subscribers, our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history, personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences, the unique features we offer subscribers, such as our instant-viewing feature, Previews, Friends R and Profiles SM , as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select, receive and return DVDs. We continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business. VOD and downloading of movies over the Internet continues to receive considerable media attention. Apple’s video iPod, Amazon’s Unbox, Wal-Mart’s DVD download offerings and announcements from other companies ranging from Google and Yahoo! to Microsoft and Intel regarding their efforts in digital delivery of content fuels public interest in the future of video entertainment delivery. Progress in digital delivery, although slow and scattered, continues to be made. VOD, for example, is now widely available to digital cable subscribers in major metropolitan areas, such as New York, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Downloading of movies over the Internet to a personal computer is currently available from providers, such as iTunes, Vongo, Movielink and CinemaNow. To this end, we introduced a new feature in January 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers. We expect to roll out this instant-viewing feature to all subscribers within six months from the date of launch, and we will continue to improve its quality, content and functionality. We intend to broaden the distribution capability of this service to multiple platforms over time. While we anticipate that new devices and services for delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years, we believe that DVD, and its high definition successors, HD-DVD and BluRay, will continue to dominate the home entertainment experience in the near term. At some point in the future, digital delivery directly to the home will surpass DVD. Our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences and our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for DVD rentals positions us favorably to further develop our digital distribution offering as that market develops. The downloading market is segmented into rental of online delivered content, the download-to-own segment and the advertising-supported online delivery segment, and we believe we will lead the rental segment with our instant-viewing feature as it develops Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had 1,300 full-time employees. We also utilize part-time and temporary employees, primarily in our fulfillment operations, to respond to the fluctuating demand for DVD shipments. As of December 31, 2006, we had 646 temporary employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Intellectual Property We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We have filed patents in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., we were issued broad business method patents covering, among other things, our subscription rental service in 2003 and 2006, and we were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005. While our patents are an important element of our business, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or acombination of patents. We have a registered service mark for the Netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks. Our software, the content of our Web site and other material which we create is protected by copyright. We also protect certain details about our business methods, processes and strategies as trade secrets, and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. To date, we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and know-how to protect our intellectual property. It is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage. From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute.

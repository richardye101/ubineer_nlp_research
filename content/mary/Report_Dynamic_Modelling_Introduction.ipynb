    "## Dynamic Topic Modelling Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this section is to analyse multiple annual reports per company to understand how companies may have changed in business direction or target industries over multiple years. \n",
    "\n",
    "We explore two types of dynamic topic modelling:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at differences in word embeddings generated by TD-IDF, Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. We take the difference between the word embedding vectors of two distinct years and evaluate the addition/reduction in certain vocabulary.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Look at differences in topics generated by Non-Negative Matrix Factorization(NMF), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). We take the difference between the document-topic vectors and evaluate the addition/reduction in certain topics.\n",

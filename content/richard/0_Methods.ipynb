    "### Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the BigQuery interface, we were able to query the data, although due to the sheer size of it (2GB+) we were unable to exatract it efficiently for analysis. Our supervisor Professor [Sotirious Damouras](https://damouras.github.io/) was able to assist us in not only extracting the `coDescription` data, but also link each filing with a Company name, it's respective `SIC` code (identifying the company's operating industry), and the country and city they are headquartered. This data only contains filings from 2018, as the team agreed it would be best to avoid years plagued with COVID, but also have the most up to date information. As mentioned previously, the sheer size of data available prevented us from extracting all the company filings so we decided to filter only companies from the top five industries (based on number of companies). That gave us 1127 unique filings to analyze.\n",

Through our analysis, we've found that many words such as \"are\" and \"is\", \"running\" and \"ran\" all carried their respective meaning, but yet represented as _different_ words. In order to condense the sheer amount of data we have (in number of words), we perform something called __lemmatization__, the process of reducing words to their base form. \"are\" and \"is\" would be converted to \"be\", and \"running\" and \"ran\" will be converted to \"run\". With less word variations to deal with, our analysis is bound to improve!\n",

These words themselves don't carry any meaning, and our goal is to extract as much semantic information as possible out of our data. As these stop words don't contriute to that goal (and they take up a LOT of room, just read the previou sentence and count the stop words!), we can further remove them to reduce the amount of data we need to process.\n",

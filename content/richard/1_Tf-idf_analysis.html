<h1>Word embedding using tf-idf matrices<a class="headerlink" href="#word-embedding-using-tf-idf-matrices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The goal of section is to find representations (embeddings) of companies in a n-dimensional space that is able to cluster similar companies together, and separate dissimilar companies. This notebook explores using tf-idf matrices to create these company embeddings.</p>
<p>Tf-Idf stands for <em>term frequency - inverse document frequency</em>. Each row in this matrix represents one document (in this case, one annaul report of a given company) and each column represents a word (or a sequence of words called an n-gram, like “University of Toronto”).</p>
<p>A term frequency matrix has the count of occurences of a given word for each document, while a tf-idf matrix performs a transformation on that term frequency matrix. The computation for each cell is as follows:</p>
<!-- \begin{align*}
\text{tf-idf}(t,d) &= \text{tf}(t,d) \cdot \text{idf}(t,d)\\ \\
\text{Where: } \quad \text{tf}(t,d) &= |t| \text{ in } d\\ \\
\text{idf}(t,d) &= \log\frac{N}{\text{df}(t)}\\
\end{align*} -->
<p><img alt="math" src="../../_images/tfidf_1.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Where <strong>t</strong> is the current term we are process, and <strong>d</strong> is the current document we are looking in</p></li>
<li><p>Where <strong>N</strong> is the total number of documents in the document set and <strong>df(t)</strong> is the document frequency of t;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The document frequency is the number of documents in the document set that contain the term t<br />
^ From <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer.html">sklearn</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do we do this?</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of a tf-idf transformation is give more importance to words that occur less frequently among all the documents. Common terms among financial documents like these could contain “financial” or “business” but they don’t provide any extra information to help us identify what makes a given company <em>unique</em>. tf-idf augments the term counts by giving higher weights to terms that are less common within the collection of documents but mentioned frequently in one document, implying these terms make this document special.</p>
<p>We’ll be training two models from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn</span></code>’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">feature_extraction</span></code>, first using a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CountVectorizer</span></code> to obtain term-frequencies of terms of size 2-4 (we do this as some terms such as “cloud computing” carry more meaning than those words do separately. We also only select the top 600 words by freqeuncy as the columns.</p>
<p>The result is then piped into a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TfidfTransformer</span></code>, augmenting the values so the values more accurately represent the <strong>importance</strong> of a given term.</p>

<p>We can see from the above PCA plot of the first three dimensions that there are clearly terms which certain industries are more drawn toward. Unfortunately, the Real Estate and Software industries still seem quite closely clustered.</p>

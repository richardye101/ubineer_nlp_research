    "# Word embedding using tf-idf matrices\n",
    "This notebook explores using tf-idf matrices to create these company embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tf-Idf stands for _term frequency - inverse document frequency_. Each row in this matrix represents one document (in this case, one annaul report of a given company) and each column represents a word (or a sequence of words called an n-gram, like \"University of Toronto\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "A term frequency matrix has the count of occurences of a given word for each document, while a tf-idf matrix performs a transformation on that term frequency matrix. The computation for each cell is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- \\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{tf-idf}(t,d) &= \\text{tf}(t,d) \\cdot \\text{idf}(t,d)\\\\ \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why do we do this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a tf-idf transformation is give more importance to words that occur less frequently among all the documents. Common terms among financial documents like these could contain \"financial\" or \"business\" but they don't provide any extra information to help us identify what makes a given company _unique_. tf-idf augments the term counts by giving higher weights to terms that are less common within the collection of documents but mentioned frequently in one document, implying these terms make this document special."

We also only select the top 600 words by freqeuncy as the columns. \n",

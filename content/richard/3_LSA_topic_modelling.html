<p>In this notebook I will attempt to reduce the high dimensional data created from tf-idf into a lower dimensional space using SVD. SVD stands for <strong>Singular Value Decomposition</strong>. It is used commonly in conjunction with tf-idf matrices to perform what is known as <strong>Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)</strong>. Contrary to PCA, SVD will not center the data before reducing dimensions, which makes it work better with sparse matrices (exactly what we have).</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is exactly the same as LDA Topic modelling.</p>
<p>This dimensionality reduction can be performed using truncated SVD. SVD, or singular value decomposition, is a technique in linear algebra that factorizes any matrix M into the product of 3 separate matrices:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[M=U*S*V\]</div>
<p>Where S is a diagonal matrix of the singular values of M. Critically, truncated SVD reduces dimensionality by selecting only the t largest singular values, and only keeping the first t columns of U and V. In this case, t is a hyperparameter we can select and adjust to reflect the number of topics we want to find.</p>
